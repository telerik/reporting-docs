# Telerik Reporting GitHub Copilot Extension

The Telerik Reporting [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) extension is an AI-powered coding assistant that provides specialized knowledge about [Telerik Reporting]({%slug telerikreporting/welcome-to-telerik-reporting!%}).

It enables AI-powered IDEs and tools to generate more accurate, tailored code that leverages [Telerik Reporting](https://www.telerik.com/products/reporting.aspx) APIs. You can ask complex questions about integrating Telerik Reporting into web applications, request specific implementations, and receive comprehensive code solutions.


## Prerequisites for the GitHub Copilot Extension

In addition to the [prerequisites for the AI Coding Assistant]({%slug ai-coding-assistant%}#prerequisites-for-the-ai-coding-assistant), before using the Telerik Reporting GitHub Copilot extension, ensure you have:

* An active [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) subscription. You can enable or configure GitHub Copilot on the [Copilot Settings page in your GitHub account](https://github.com/settings/copilot).
* A [Telerik user account](https://www.telerik.com/account/).
* An active [DevCraft or Telerik Reporting license](https://www.telerik.com/purchase.aspx?filter=web) or a [Telerik Reporting trial](https://www.telerik.com/reporting).
* An application that uses the [Telerik Reporting]({%slug telerikreporting/welcome-to-telerik-reporting!%}).
* (Recommended) The latest version of your [Copilot-enabled app](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/about-building-copilot-extensions#supported-clients-and-ides) (for example, Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code).

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and configure the Telerik Reporting Copilot extension:

1. Go to the [Telerik Reporting GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/telerikreporting) page and click the **Install** button.

	![Install the Telerik Reporting GitHub App](images/ai-copilot-extension-install.png)

1. You will see a list that includes your GitHub account and all GitHub organizations that you are part of. **Select your GitHub account**.
1. Click the **Install & Authorize** button. This will allow the GitHub Copilot extension to integrate with your GitHub account.

	![Authorize the Telerik Reporting GitHub App](images/copilot-extension-authorize.png)

1. Enter your GitHub password when prompted.
1. You will be redirected to **telerik.com**. Enter your **Telerik account** credentials if prompted. This step links the GitHub Copilot extension with your Telerik account.
1. Upon successful Telerik authentication, you will be redirected to a confirmation page that confirms the Copilot extension has been installed successfully.
1. Restart your [Copilot-enabled app](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/about-building-copilot-extensions#supported-clients-and-ides) (for example, Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code).
1. Start a new chat session in Copilot.

## Usage

> When switching between tasks and files, start a new session in a new chat window to avoid polluting the context with irrelevant or outdated information.

To use the Telerik Reporting Copilot extension:

1. Choose your preferred mode and model.<br/>At the time of publishing, **Claude Sonnet 4** and **GPT-5** produce optimal results.
1. Open the GitHub Copilot chat window in your [Copilot-enabled app](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/about-building-copilot-extensions#supported-clients-and-ides) (for example, Visual Studio or VS Code).
1. Ensure you are in **Chat** mode and not in **Edit** or **Agent** mode. The Edit and Agent modes do not use the Telerik Copilot extension. However, the Agent mode can use the [Telerik Reporting MCP server]({%slug ai-mcp-server%}).
1. Start your prompt with `@telerikreporting` and type your request. Verify that `@telerikreporting` is recognized and highlighted; otherwise the extension may not have been properly installed.

1. Look for a status label such as **Telerik Reporting working...** or **Telerik Reporting generating response...** in the output to confirm the extension is active.

1. Grant permission to the Telerik Reporting extension to read your workspace files when prompted.
1. For unrelated queries, start a new chat session in a new window to avoid context pollution from previous conversations.

>caption Using the Copilot Extension along with the MCP Server>
If you have both the extension and the [MCP Server]({%slug ai-mcp-server%}) installed, you can use the `#telerik_reporting_assistant` handle. The handle works in both **Ask** and **Agent** modes and triggers responses from the MCP Server instead of the extension.

### Sample Prompts

The following examples demonstrate useful prompts for the Telerik Reporting extension:

* "`@telerikreporting` Add a Telerik Report Viewer to my native Angular application."
* "`@telerikreporting` Connect the Telerik Report Viewer to my Telerik Report Server instance."

>tip Visit the [Telerik Reporting Prompt Library]({%slug ai-prompt-library%}) for more sample prompts.

## Usage Limits

A Telerik [Subscription license](https://www.telerik.com/purchase.aspx?filter=web) is recommended in order to use the Telerik Reporting AI Coding Assistant without restrictions. Perpetual license holders and trial users can make a [limited number of requests per year]({%slug ai-coding-assistant%}#number-of-requests).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

* Ensure the `@telerikreporting` mention is properly highlighted in your prompt.
* Verify that you have an active GitHub Copilot subscription.
* Restart your IDE after installation.
* Check that you're in Chat mode, not Edit or Agent mode.

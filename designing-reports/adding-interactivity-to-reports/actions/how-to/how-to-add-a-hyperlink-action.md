# How to Add a Hyperlink Action

Add a hyperlink to a URL when you want users to be able to click a link in a report and open a browser     	to the URL you specify. You must ensure that the user has access to the URL that you provide i.e. it allows anonymous access or does not require credentials.      	You can add a hyperlink to a URL to any item that has an Action property. 

## Adding a Hyperlink action using Report Designer

1. In Design view, right-click a report item to which you want to add a link and then click __Properties__.

1. In the Properties dialog box, click __Action__.

1. Select __Navigate to URL__. An additional section appears in the dialog box for this option.

1. In __Target URL__  TextBox, type a URL or an expression that evaluates to a URL.

1. Click __OK__.

1. To test the link, run the report and click the report item with the applied __Action__. For TextBoxes, it is
	helpful to change the color and effect of the text to indicate that the text is a link. For example, change the color to blue and
	the effect to underline by setting the corresponding __Font__  properties of the TextBox.

## Adding a Hyperlink action programatically

{{source=CodeSnippets\CS\API\Telerik\Reporting\ActionSnippets.cs region=AddNewNavigateToUrlSnippet}}
````C#
	Telerik.Reporting.NavigateToUrlAction UrlAction1 = new Telerik.Reporting.NavigateToUrlAction();
	UrlAction1.Url = "http://demos.telerik.com/reporting";
	textBox1.Action = UrlAction1;
````
{{source=CodeSnippets\VB\API\Telerik\Reporting\ActionSnippets.vb region=AddNewNavigateToUrlSnippet}}
````VB
	Dim UrlAction1 As New Telerik.Reporting.NavigateToUrlAction()
	UrlAction1.Url = "http://demos.telerik.com/reporting"
	textBox1.Action = UrlAction1
````

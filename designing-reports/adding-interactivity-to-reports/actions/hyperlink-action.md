# Hyperlink Action

You can add a hyperlink to a report item so that a user can access a Web page by clicking the item. A hyperlink can be a static URL or an expression that evaluates to a URL. If you have a field in a database	that contains URLs, the expression can contain that field, resulting in a dynamic list of hyperlinks in the report. You can define a hyperlink on any report item. 

>warning Hyperlink URL-s should be absolute by design. This ensures they are compatible with all of the report viewers and supported rendering formats.           


To define a hyperlink add a [NavigateToUrlAction](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.NavigateToUrlAction) on an item.

You can also specify whether the URL is opened in the same or new browser window using the [Target](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.NavigateToUrlAction#Telerik_Reporting_NavigateToUrlAction_Target)  property.

>warning Opening URL in the same window is only applicable for the [ASP.NET Web Forms Report Viewer](../../../using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/asp.net-web-forms-report-viewer/overview%}) and [Silverlight Application](../../../using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/silverlight-application/overview%}). For the others, the [NavigateToUrlAction](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.NavigateToUrlAction) would be opened in a new window.

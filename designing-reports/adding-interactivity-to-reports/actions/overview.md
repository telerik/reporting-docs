# Actions Overview

You can add interactive actions that allow users to open Web pages or other reports, jump to another location within the same report or drilldown to detail data. To add an interactive action, you define an Action on a report item. Use the [Edit Action dialog]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/edit-action-dialog%}) to set the type of interactive action. When the user clicks that report item, the action that you define takes place. The report engine supports the following action types: 

* __Navigate to Report__ : Jump to other reports from the main report (Drillthrough report). 

* __Navigate to Bookmark__ : Jump to areas within a report. 

* __Navigate to Url__ : Jump to external web URLs that specify the address of web pages. 

* __Toggle Visibility__ : Show or hide report items within the same report. 

* __Sorting__ : Apply sorting on report items like __Table__ , __Crosstab__ or __Graph__. 

* __Custom__ : An action that contains collection of parameters that are evaluated during report processing. 

> The actions are feature of the report viewers and not of the rendering extension. You can find more info about the supported interactive features in each format by checking the Interactivity section of the respective articles in [Design Considerations for Report Rendering Overview]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/rendering-and-paging/design-considerations-for-report-rendering/overview%}) help section.

# Sorting Table Details

This document demonstrates how to enable interactive sorting with the __Standalone Report Designer__ or with the __Visual Studio Report Designer__.        

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps in this guide, you need the following:         

* A Telerik Reporting installation with an enabled [Examples feature]({%slug telerikreporting/installation%})

* Microsoft SQL Server with AdventureWorks         			

## Procedure

The following steps describe how to add an interactive __sort__ button to a column header in the __Detail Section__ of a report. This enables a user to click on the button and sort the table rows by the value displayed in that column.         

1. Locate the __Product Catalog__ sample report and open it with the __Standalone Report Designer__ or with the __Visual Studio Report Designer__. Depending on the Report Designer of your choice, you will locate the __Product Catalog__ sample report in one of the following folders:             

   + Examples for the Standalone Report Designer - %PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Progress\Telerik Reporting {Version}\Report Designer\Examples                 

   + Examples for the Visual Studio Report Designer â€“ %PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Progress\Telerik Reporting {Version}\Examples\CSharp\                 

   >note Replace __{Version}__ in the Examples path with your Telerik Reporting version.               

1. In the Report Designer, make sure you use __Design View__.             

1. Select the __List Price__ text box - this is the column header where we want to add an interactive sorting button.             

1. In the __Properties__ window, open the __Action__ editor.             

1. Select the __Sorting__ action.             

1. Click the __Select sort targets__ button. The __Edit Sorting Action targets__ window appears.             

1. Click the __New__ button to add a new target.             

1. Select __table1 (Table)__ in the drop-down and click __OK__.             

1. In the __Sort expressions__ drop-down menu, select the field that corresponds to the column for which you are defining a sorting action. In this case, use the __=Fields.ListPrice__ expression and click __OK__.             

   >note Specifying a sort expression is required.

To verify the sorting action:         

1. Preview the report

1. Navigate to __Bikes__ in the document map

1. Click the __List Price__ column interactive sorting button.

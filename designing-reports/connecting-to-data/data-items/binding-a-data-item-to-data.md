# Binding a Data item to Data



You can work with a data item by binding it to a data source component such as an         __ObjectDataSource__  or a __SqlDataSource__ .         The data source component connects to a         data source such as a database or middle-tier object to retrieve the data.         The data-bound item will then use this data. To perform the binding, you need to set the         data item's __DataSource__  property to point to a         data source component. When a data-bound         item is bound to a data source component, little or no additional code is required for data         operations, because the data-bound item can automatically take advantage of the         data services provided by the data source component.       

>note For backwards compatibility reasons Telerik Reporting supports binding directly to  __IEnumberable__ / __IListSource__  objects (incl. arrays, collections,  __DataSet__ ,  __DataTable__ ,  __DataView__ , and  __DbDataAdapter__ ). Instead consider using the  __ObjectDataSource__  that can handle these types of data sources.         


## Binding to data at design-time

Data Source Components are used to connect to data at design-time. Having valid data source attached to a           [Data Source Component]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-source-components/overview%}) at design-time allows you to take advantage           of all design time features and work with the [Data Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-explorer%}).           For more information please see [Data Source Components]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-source-components/overview%}) and           [DataSource Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-source-wizards/datasource-wizard%}).           After you create and configure a data source component via its wizard you can assign it to the data item's __DataSource__  property           using the __Properties__  window in the report designer.         

## Binding to data at run-time

To bind a data item to data at run-time, you need to access the __DataSource__  property of the data item           and set its value programmatically.           For more information on how to access data items please see [Access Report Items Programmatically]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/program-the-report-definition/access-report-items-programmatically%}).         

## Binding to data from the parent data item

Oftentimes the data needed for your Table, Chart, or another data item will already be present in the parent's data source           e.g., the report's data source.           In such cases, you can improve the report performance by reusing the data from the parent,           instead of creating and configuring a new data source component to retrieve the data anew.           You can reuse the data by adding a [Binding]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/bindings%})           to the data item's __DataSource__  property, which sets the following expression:         

*= ReportItem.DataObject* 

The __DataObject__  property is an object instance representing the data that an item is bound to when processed.           Depending on the [Data Scope]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/expression-scope-%})           in which the data item is present, __DataObject__  may return all of the parent's data           or a selection of its data rows. For example, binding a Graph located inside a report group will result in the Graph           retrieving data only for the current report group instance.                   

>note To reach the data of an item that is higher in the hierarchy, you can use  __Parent__  keyword:            *= ReportItem.Parent.DataObject* Parent keyword can be used as many times as neccessary in order to reach the required item.

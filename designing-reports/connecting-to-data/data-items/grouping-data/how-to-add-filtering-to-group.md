# How to Add filtering to Group

A filter defined on a report/table group limits the group members to certain values. These filters operate over the group members after the groups are calculated. Group filters are similar to the HAVING clause in a SQL statement. 

We will use the filter to hide/show the dynamic groups members. Additionally we add the possibility for dynamic filtering by using report parameters. The example shown is based on the [ProductSales](https://demos.telerik.com/reporting/product-sales) demo report

## Using dynamic filter to show/hide crosstab group members

1. Open the report in the designer and show the Group Explorer

1. Define a new [Report Parameter]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/report-parameters/how-to-add-report-parameters%}) _DetailsForYear_ as shown on the picture. Use the same DataSource as for the report. The parameter should be MultiValue.

1. Select the Crosstab (or any cell in it) and invoke the [Edit Filters dialog]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/edit-filter-dialog%}) for the _Qtr Column_ group. Enter the filter expression as shown on next picture

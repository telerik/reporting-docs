# Adding Groups to Report

Report groups are defined by adding __Group__ objects to the reportâ€™s __Groups__ collection. Report groups are always nested according to the order in the Group's collection. To display group data one should use the __GroupHeaderSection__ and __GroupFooterSection__ that appear once for each group member, respectively at start and end. The DetailSection displays detailed data in a report and always appears inside the innermost group (if any). To add a group, follow these steps:

## Adding a group to a Report using Report Designer

1. Click the Report selector button located in the upper left hand of the [Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/overview%})
1. Click the __Groups__ ellipsis.
1. Follow these steps for each group:

	1. Click the Add button - a new unbound group will be added to the __Groups__ collection.
	1. Click the Grouping property ellipsis.
	1. From the Edit [Grouping dialog]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/edit-grouping-dialog%}), type or select an expression by which to group the data.
	1. To apply sorting to the group, follow these steps:

		+ Click the Sorting ellipsis.
		+ Click New.
		+ Type or select an expression by which to sort the data.
		+ From the Direction column drop-down list, choose the sort direction for each expression. ASC sorts the expressions in ascending order. DESC sorts the expressions in descending order.

	1. To apply filtering to the group, follow these steps:

		+ Click the Filters ellipsis.
		+ Click New.
		+ In Expression, type or select the expression for the field to filter. To open the Edit Expression Dialog, select the `<Expression>` option.
		+ In the Operator box, select the operator that you want the filter to use to compare the values in the Expression box and the Value box.
		+ In the Value box, type the expression or value against which you want the filter to evaluate the value in Expression.

	1. In Name, type the name of the group.
	1. Click GroupKeepTogether to specify the keep-together options.
	1. Click BookMarkID to set a BookMark for this group.

1. Click Ok twice to close the Edit Grouping and Group Collection dialogs.

> You can add a group to the Report item by using the grouping pane in the [Group Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/group-explorer%}) as well. To do so right click on the detail and select __Add Parent Group__. If there are existing groups, you can create Parent or Child groups by right-clicking on any of the existing groups.

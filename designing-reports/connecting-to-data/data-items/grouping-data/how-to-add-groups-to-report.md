# How to Add groups to Report



Report groups are defined by adding __Group__  objects to the reportâ€™s __Groups__  collection. Report groups are always nested according to the order in the Groups collection. To display group data one should use the __GroupHeaderSection__  and __GroupFooterSection__  that appear once for each group member, respectively at start and end. The DetailSection displays detail data in a report and always appears inside the innermost group (if any). To add a group, follow these steps:

## Adding a group to a Report using Report Designer

1. Click the Report selector button located in the upper left hand of the[Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/overview%})

1. Click the __Groups__  ellipsis.

1. Follow these steps for each group:

   1. 	          				Click Add button - a new unbound group will be added to the __Groups__  collection. 
	                    

   1. 	                    	Click the Grouping property ellipsis. 
	          			

   1. 				        	From the Edit [Grouping dialog]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/edit-grouping-dialog%}), type or select an expression by which to group the data. 
				        

   1. 	          				To apply sorting to the group, follow these steps:
          				

   +           				     	Click the Sorting ellipsis.
          					 

   + 					         	Click New
					         

   + 					         	Type or select an expression by which to sort the data. 
					         

   + 					         	From the Direction column drop-down list, choose the sort direction for each expression. ASC sorts the expression in ascending order. DESC sorts the expression in descending order.
					         

   1.           				To apply filtering to the group, follow these steps:
          				

   +           					   		Click the Filters ellipsis 
          					   

   +           			           		Click New. 
         					   

   +                     		   		In Expression, type or select the expression for the field to filter. To open the Edit Expression Dialog, select the ```<Expression>``` option.
          					   

   +                     		   		In the Operator box, select the operator that you want the filter to use to compare the values in the Expression box and the Value box. 
          					   

   +                                		In the Value box, type the expression or value against which you want the filter to evaluate the value in Expression.
          				       

   1.           			 		In Name, type the name of the group. 
          			

   1.                     		Click GroupKeepTogether to specify the keep together options. 
          			

   1.                     		Click BookMarkID to set a BookMark for this group.

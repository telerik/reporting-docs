# How to Add groups to Table item and Crosstab item



Add groups to a data item when you want to display your data in a        visual hierarchy, align multiple data items to show different views of the       same data, or to calculate totals.       

You can create both nested groups and adjacent groups. Within a data        item, you can create multiple row groups and column groups.

Typically, you define groups automatically as you work with data regions.       However, you can add your own groups. The process of adding groups varies        based on the type of data region.       In a Table, Crosstab or List items, drag data source fields to the Row/Column        Fields area. Right-click an existing group to add       parent, child or adjacent groups. By definition, the details group is the innermost group and       can only be added as a child group. Right-click an existing group to delete       it. Rows and columns on which to display group values are automatically added        for you. For more information, see [Working with Table]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/table-crosstab-list/overview%}) article.       

## Add a parent or child row/column group to a Table data item using Report Designer

1. Drag a data source field from the[Data Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-explorer%})

1. Drop the field above or below the group hierarchy using the guide 
            bar to place the group as a parent group or a child group to an existing group.

The group is added with a default name, group expression, and sort 
            expression that is based on the field name.

## Add an adjacent row/column group to a Table data item

1. 

In the [Group Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/group-explorer%}) group pane, 
            right-click a group that is a peer to the group that you want to add. 
            Click Add Group, and then click __Adjacent Before__  
            or __Adjacent After__  to specify where to add the group. The
            __Table Group__  dialog box opens.

1. Click __New__  button.

1. 

In the group expression, type an expression, 
            select a data source field or create a new expression. The group is 
            added with a default name __RowGroup__  or __ColumnGroup__  respectively.
            

1. Click __OK__  .

1. Right-click the group, and then click __Group Properties__  .

1. In __Name__  , type the name of the group.

1. 

In __Grouping property__ , type or select a simple expression, or 
            click the ```<Expression>``` option to create a new group expression.

1. Click __New__  to create additional expressions. 
            All expressions you specify are combined using a logical AND to specify data for this group.

1. To apply sorting to the group, follow these steps:

   + Click the Sorting ellipsis

   + Click New.

   + Type or select an expression by which to sort the data.

   + From the Direction column drop-down list, choose the sort direction 
  for each expression. ASC sorts the expression in ascending order. DESC sorts 
  the expression in descending order.

1. To apply filtering to the group, follow these steps:

   + Click the Filters ellipsis

   + Click New.

   + In __Expression__ , type or select the expression for the field to filter. To open the __Edit Expression__  Dialog, select the ```<Expression>``` option.

   + In the __Operator__  box, select the operator that you want the filter to use to compare the values in the Expression box and the Value box.

   + In the __Value__  box, type the expression or value against which you want the filter to evaluate the value in Expression.

1. Click __GroupKeepTogether__  to specify the keep together options.

1. Click __BookMarkID__  to set a BookMark for this group.

1. Click __OK__  .

A new group is added to the grouping pane in the [Group Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/group-explorer%}) 
      and a row or column on which to display group values is added to the Table data item on the 
      design surface.

## Add a details group to a Table data item using Report Designer

  In the [Group Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/group-explorer%}) group pane, 
            right-click a group that is the innermost child group. Click Add Group, 
            and then click Child Group. The __Table Group__  dialog box opens.
  

1. Leave the expression blank - a details group has no expression.

1. 

Select __Show detail data__ .
            

1. Click __OK__ .

1. Right-click the group, and then click __Group Properties__ .

1. Click __BookMarkID__  to set a BookMark for this group.

1. Click __OK__ .

A new details group is added as a child group in the Grouping pane in the 
      [Group Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/group-explorer%}), 
      and the new group displays the details group icon.

## Delete a group from a Table data item using Report Designer

1. In the [Group Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/group-explorer%}) group pane, 
            right-click the group, and then click __Delete Group__ .

  group data. For the details group, if the same row belongs to both detail and 
  group data, only the detail data rows are deleted.

   + __Delete group only__    Choose this option to keep
  the structure of the Table data item the same and delete only the group definition.

1. Click __OK__ .

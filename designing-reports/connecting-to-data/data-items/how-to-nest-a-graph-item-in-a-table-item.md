# How to Nest a Graph Item in a Table item



The Telerik Reporting data items are used to present data by two dimensions (the Table defines Row and Column groups, the Graph defines Category and Series groups).         Often it is useful to create another dimension, which will result in an additional data "slice" and will give us the opportunity to display more measures.       

This can be achieved with simply nesting data items. In this case the nested data item will get its data from the “master” data item,         binding its data source to the master item's DataObject.       

As a real life scenario, in the current example we will list the top 5 performing agents and the amount of their sales divided by product categories         on a yearly basis, presented in a pie chart. We will use a [Crosstab item]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/table-crosstab-list/understanding-crosstab-areas%}) as a master data item and it will define the dimensions “Sales Person Name” and “Year”.         For a nested data item we will use a [Graph item]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/graph/structure%}) which will add the dimension “Product Category”.       

We will use the __AdventureWorks__  sample database and the [Telerik Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/overview%}).       

## How to nest a Graph item in a Table item

1. Open the Telerik Report Designer and create a new report.

1. Cancel the Telerik Report Wizard, because it would not be needed for the current example.

1. Start the CrossTab Wizard and create a new DataSource with the following select statement:

	
    ````sql

SELECT
C.FirstName + ' ' + COALESCE (C.MiddleName, '') + ' ' + C.LastName AS SalesPersonName
, YEAR(SOH.OrderDate) as OrderYear
, PC.Name as CategoryName
FROM
Sales.SalesPerson AS SP
INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS SOH ON SOH.SalesPersonID = SP.SalesPersonID
INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderDetail AS SOD ON SOD.SalesOrderID = SOH.SalesOrderID
INNER JOIN Production.Product AS P ON P.ProductID = SOD.ProductID
INNER JOIN Production.ProductSubcategory AS PSC ON PSC.ProductSubcategoryID = P.ProductSubcategoryID
INNER JOIN Production.ProductCategory AS PC ON PC.ProductCategoryID = PSC.ProductCategoryID
INNER JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS E ON E.EmployeeID = SP.SalesPersonID
INNER JOIN Person.Contact AS C ON C.ContactID = E.ContactID
````




1. On the following page add the __SalesPersonName__  field to the __RowGroups__  box,               __OrderYear__  to the __Column Groups__  box and the               __CategoryName__  field to the __Detail Values__  box,               where it will be automatically changed to __Count(CategoryName)__ .               After the wizard ends, you can make some design adjustments to the generated crosstab to make it look better.             

1. Set the row group's __Filters__  to `"Count(Fields.CategoryName) Top N =5"`.               Your group properties should now be set like this:

1. Set the crosstab headers to `"Person Name"` and `"Total Sales"`               and the row group textbox expressions to `"Fields.SalesPersonName"` and `"Count(CategoryName)"`:               

  ![di Nest Graph In Table Cross Tab Layout](images/DataItems/di_NestGraphInTable_CrossTabLayout.png)    If you preview the report now, you will see that the crosstab shows the top 5 sales agents               along with their sales count by year.                 Now we have to set up the pie chart which will display their sales divided by product categories.             

1. Select the cell that displays the count and choose the __Pie Chart__  item from the __Insert__  menu.               The __Graph Wizard__  will appear. Since we will bind our graph to the current __ReportItem.DataObject__ ,               actually there is no need to connect it to a data source, but on the other hand, the design-time support might come in handy.             

1. Select the data source and on the next page add the __CategoryName__  field               to the __Series__  and __Values__  box,               where it will be automatically changed to `Count(CategoryName)`.               You can make some additional adjustments like removing the graph title, aligning the texts               and resizing the crosstab's rows and columns. Finally your crosstab should look like the one below:               

  ![di Nest Graph In Table Crosstab With Graph](images/DataItems/di_NestGraphInTable_CrosstabWithGraph.png)    If you preview the report, you will notice that the chart data stays the same on every row and column of the crosstab.               That's why we connected it to the whole dataset. In order to connect it to the current row group data,               defined by the expression `"Fields.SalesPersonName"`, we have to bind the graph data source               to the current report item's data object.             

1. Open the Graph's [Bindings]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/bindings%}) editor and create a new binding for the DataSource property as shown below:               

  ![di Nest Graph In Table Bindings Editor](images/DataItems/di_NestGraphInTable_BindingsEditor.png)    Since we are explicitly binding the __DataSource__  property, we don't need to declare it               in the Graph's properties, so you can set it to __No Data Source__ . Please note that this will               cancel the design-time support and the data will not be previewed in the graph designer.                 Your report is now ready. When you preview it, you will see that the pie chart is displayed on every               cross-section of a sales person and an year, showing the percentage of the product categories sales.             

## Live examples

You can download the described report as a __.trdx__  report definition from the following link:            [Nested Graph Item in a Table Item](http://blogs.telerik.com/docs/default-source/reporting/nestedgraphiteminatableitem583E43B84F9C.zip?sfvrsn=2) 

The same approach is used in the __Product Sales__  example report which is shipped with the Telerik Reporting installation.           This report displays the monthly sales trend using a line chart for the product subcategories and a column chart for the total fields.           You can see the report in action if you have a valid connection to the __AdventureWorks__  sample database.

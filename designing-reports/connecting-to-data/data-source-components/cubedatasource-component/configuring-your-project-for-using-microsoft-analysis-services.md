# Configuring your project for using Microsoft Analysis Services

Before utilizing the __CubeDataSource__ component in your reports you need to configure your report class library for using __Microsoft Analysis Services__  first:       

1. __Install the Microsoft ADOMD.NET client data provider__ : The __CubeDataSource__ component requires the __Microsoft ADOMD.NET__ client data provider to be installed on your machine. The present version of __Telerik Reporting__ is compiled against the __ADOMD.NET__ provider for __SQL Server 2008 R2__.             

1. __Add the required assembly references to your project:__ You need to add the following assembly references to your report class library:             

   + __Microsoft.AnalysisServices.AdomdClient__ - this is the __ADOMD.NET__ client data provider assembly which is normally located in the following directory after installation: 
   
     *"```<Program Files>```\Microsoft.NET\ADOMD.NET\```<Product Version>```".* 
   
     Here *"```<Program Files>```"*  is the directory with your program files, and *"```<Product Version>```"* is the version of the installed product (this should be __100__ for __ADOMD.NET for SQL Server 2008 R2__).

   + __Telerik.Reporting.Adomd__ - this is the __Telerik Reporting__ provider assembly for __ADOMD.NET__ which is located in the *"Bin"*  subdirectory of your __Telerik Reporting__ installation.                 

1. __Add an assembly binding redirect if necessary:__ The current version of __Telerik Reporting__ uses __ADOMD.NET__ for __SQL Server 2008 R2__. Please, verify that the version of the __Microsoft.AnalysisServices.AdomdClient__ assembly is *"10.0.0.0"*. If you have a greater version of that assembly you need to add an appropriate assembly binding redirect in the configuration file of the start application as illustrated below: 

    
   ````xml
<configuration>
<runtime>
<assemblyBinding xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1">
<dependentAssembly>
<assemblyIdentity name="Microsoft.AnalysisServices.AdomdClient"
publicKeyToken="89845dcd8080cc91"
culture="neutral" />
<bindingRedirect oldVersion="0.0.0.0-65535.65535.65535.65535"
newVersion="<Your Version>" />
</dependentAssembly>
</assemblyBinding>
</runtime>
</configuration>
````

   Here *"```<Your Version>```"* is the actual version of your __Microsoft.AnalysisServices.AdomdClient__ assembly. In the case of a ClassLibrary project containing report definitions, the binding redirects should be applied in Visual Studio configuration file (__devenv.exe.config__).

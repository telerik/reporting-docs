# EntityDataSource Component Overview



The __EntityDataSource__ component enables data items to connect to an  [ADO.NET Entity Data Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/entity-data-model).          This allows seamless integration of __Telerik Reporting__ with applications or web sites that utilize          the  [ADO.NET Entity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/ef/overview). There are several main benefits when using the __EntityDataSource__        component for connecting to an __Entity Data Model__ :

*  __Dedicated design-time support:__ the __EntityDataSource__ component has its own set of design-time editors,
    tool windows, and a configuration wizard. In addition to this, __EntityDataSource__ adds support for entity schema
    in __Data Explorer__ and live data preview of the report in __Report Designer__.

*  __Configuring database connectivity:__ the __EntityDataSource__ component offers an additional level of 
    control over the database connectivity of the Entity Data Model. You can specify a connection string or a named 
    connection from the configuration file of the main application or web site. That ensures __EntityDataSource__ can 
    establish a valid database connection both at design-time and when running the report in production.

*  __Maintaining ObjectContext/DbContext lifecycle:__ the __EntityDataSource__ component allows 
    the option to maintain the entire lifecycle of the __ObjectContext__ or __DbContext__ automatically. It can create its own
    instance of one of the two contexts internally, keep it alive for the duration of the report generation process,
    and then destroy it automatically when it is no longer needed by the reporting engine.

   >    When using  __DbContext__ by default the context class generated (Database First or Model First) provides only a default (parameterless) constructor.      However for design time purposes a constructor with connection string (string argument) is needed so that while processing the report the correct      connection string can be passed.      If Code First is used there is no need for a constructor with string parameter.      That is because this approach uses connection strings without metadata (which is  needed for the mapping). This means that the connection string of the context can be directly set to this connection string, without the need to be resolved first.      Adding the needed constructor is as simple as it is adding the snippet below:    

    
      ````C#
partial class AdventureWorksContext
{
public AdventureWorksContext(string connectionString) : base(connectionString) {}
}
````
````VB
Partial Class AdventureWorksContext
Public Sub New(connectionString As String)
MyBase.New(connectionString)
End Sub
End Class
````

> In order to use the [Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/overview%}) and [Report Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/band-report-wizard/overview%})           the Entity Data Model should be located in a separate class library. The connectionString to the database should be copied to the config file of the report class           library for the [Data Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-explorer%}) and Preview to work.

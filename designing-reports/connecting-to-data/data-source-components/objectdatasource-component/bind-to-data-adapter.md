# Binding ObjectDataSource Component to a DataAdapter

The following example illustrates how to use a `DataAdapter` as the source for an `ObjectDataSource` component. The example demonstrates also how to configure the report to use the `ObjectDataSource` and how to preview it in the Windows Forms Report Viewer.

The `ObjectDataSource` component allows you to use directly a class that implements the `System.Data.IDataAdapter` interface. In the sample code below an instance of the `SqlDataAdapter` class is created and passed to the `DataSource` property of the `ObjectDataSource` component. When the `DataAdapter` encounters multiple result sets, it creates multiple tables and each table is given an incremental default name of TableN, starting with "Table" for Table0. In this case you have to set the `DataMember` property of the `ObjectDataSource` component to indicate exactly which table to bind to. Additionally a sample calculated field is added that can be used in the report definition in the same way as a regular field.

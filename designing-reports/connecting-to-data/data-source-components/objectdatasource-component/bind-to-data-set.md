# Binding ObjectDataSource Component to a DataSet

The following example illustrates how to use a `DataSet` as the source for an `ObjectDataSource` component. The example demonstrates also how to configure the report to use the `ObjectDataSource` and how to preview it in the Windows Forms Report Viewer.

In the code snippet below a `DataSet` object is filled with three tables and then used for the `DataSource` property of the `ObjectDataSource` component. The `DataMemeber` property of the `ObjectDataSource` component is set to indicate to which one of the three tables to bind to. Additionally a sample calculated field is added which can be used in the report definition in the same way as a regular field.

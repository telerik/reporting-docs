The following example illustrates how to use a `DataTable` as the source for an `ObjectDataSource` component. The code below additionally creates a calculated field that can be used in the report definition in the same way as a regular field. The example demonstrates also how to configure the report to use the `ObjectDataSource` and how to preview it in the Windows Forms Report Viewer.

# How to Bind to a DataView



The following example illustrates how to use a __DataView__ as the source       for an __ObjectDataSource__ component.

The sample code below shows how to pass a __DataView__    object to the __DataSource__    property of the __ObjectDataSource__ component. __DataView__ is usually used when we       want to work only with a subset of data from the __DataTable__. Additionally a       sample calculated field is added that can be used in the report definition in       the same way as a regular field.

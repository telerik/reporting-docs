# ObjectDataSource Component Overview

A common application design practice is to separate the presentation layer from business logic and encapsulate the business logic in business objects. These business objects form a layer between the presentation layer and the data tier, resulting in a multi-tier application architecture. The ObjectDataSource component supports the multi-tier architecture by providing a way for you to bind the Data Report Items to a middle-tier business object without extensive code. The ObjectDataSource component represents the middle-tier object (business object or any other class) and provides data retrieval capabilities. 

## Supported object types

Any of the following data sources can be assigned to the DataSource property of the ObjectDataSource component:

* Any component that implements __[IEnumerable](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ienumerable.aspx)__, including __[System.Array](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.array.aspx)__,               __[IList](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ilist.aspx)__,               __[ICollection](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.icollection.aspx)__, and __[BindingSource](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.bindingsource.aspx)__

* Any component that implements __[IListSource](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.ilistsource.aspx)__, including __[DataTable](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.datatable(VS.80).aspx)__, __[DataSet](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.dataset.aspx)__ and DataView 

* Any component that implements __[IDbDataAdapter](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.idbdataadapter.aspx)__, including __SqlDataAdapter__ and __OleDbDataAdapter__ 

* System.Type which represents the type of the business object 

## Requirements for the DataSource

* If the __DataSource__ reference contains more than one table, you must set the __DataMember__ property to a string that specifies the table to bind to. 

  For example, if the DataSource is a DataSet or DataViewManager that contains three tables named __Customers__, __Orders__, and __OrderDetails__, you need to specify the table to bind to. 

* If the name of the __DataMember__ (i.e. the table to bind to) is not specified, __the first Table of the DataSet__ will be bound to the __DataSource__.         

* If the __DataSource__ references a strongly typed array of objects (business objects) these objects must contain public properties.         

* If the __DataSource__ is a business object, the __DataMember__ property specifies the name of the method which should be invoked to retrieve the data. 

* If the __DataMember__ property is not specified, the constructor of the type will be invoked.             

* If the constructor or the method contains arguments they can be specified through the __Parameters__ collection of the __ObjectDataSource__ component.         

* You can also bind to an __ArrayList__. A feature of the __ArrayList__ is that it can contain objects of multiple types. The __ObjectDataSource__ component binds to such a list despite the types of items in it. The only requirement is that they provide public properties with the same names as they are used in the expressions. 

* Already instantiated data objects do not have to be wrapped in a data source component. Instantiated data objects can be set directly to data items' DataSource properties. 

## Supported developer platforms

*.NET Framework 4.0 and above             

*.NET Core 2.0 and above             

*.NET Standard 2.0 and above

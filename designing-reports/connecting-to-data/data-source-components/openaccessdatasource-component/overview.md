# OpenAccessDataSource Component Overview

The `OpenAccessDataSource` component enables data items to connect to an __Telerik Data Access Model__. This allows seamless integration of __Telerik Reporting__ with applications or web sites that utilize __Telerik Data Access__. There are several main benefits when using the `OpenAccessDataSource` component for connecting to a __Telerik Data Access Model__:

*__Dedicated design-time support__ : the `OpenAccessDataSource` component has its own set of design-time editors, tool windows, and a configuration wizard. In addition to this, `OpenAccessDataSource` adds support for entity schema in __Data Explorer__ and live data preview of the report in __Report Designer__.

*__Configuring database connectivity__ : the `OpenAccessDataSource` component offers an additional level of control over the database connectivity of the __Telerik Data Access Model__. You can specify a connection string or a named connection from the configuration file of the main application or web site. That ensures `OpenAccessDataSource` can establish a valid database connection both at design-time and when running the report in production.

*__Maintaining OpenAccessContext lifecycle__ : the `OpenAccessDataSource` component allows the option to maintain the entire lifecycle of the `OpenAccessContext` automatically. It can create its own instance of the `OpenAccessContext` internally, keep it alive for the duration of the report generation process, and then destroy it automatically when it is no longer needed by the reporting engine.

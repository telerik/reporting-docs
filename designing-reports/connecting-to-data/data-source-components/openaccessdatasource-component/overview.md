# OpenAccessDataSource Component Overview



The __OpenAccessDataSource__ component enables data items to connect to an __Telerik Data Access Model__. This allows         seamless integration of __Telerik Reporting__ with applications or web sites that utilize __Telerik Data Access__.         There are several main benefits when using the __OpenAccessDataSource__ component for connecting to a         __Telerik Data Access Model__ :       

*  __Dedicated design-time support__ : the __OpenAccessDataSource__ component has its own set of design-time editors,
            tool windows, and a configuration wizard. In addition to this, __OpenAccessDataSource__ adds
            support for entity schema in __Data Explorer__ and live data preview of the report in __Report Designer__.

*  __Configuring database connectivity__ : the __OpenAccessDataSource__ component
            offers an additional level of control over the database connectivity of the __Telerik Data Access Model__. You can
            specify a connection string or a named connection from the configuration file of the main application or web site.
            That ensures __OpenAccessDataSource__ can establish a valid database connection both at design-time and when
            running the report in production.

*  __Maintaining OpenAccessContext lifecycle__ : the __OpenAccessDataSource__ component
            allows the option to maintain the entire lifecycle of the __OpenAccessContext__ automatically. It can create its
            own instance of the __OpenAccessContext__ internally, keep it alive for the duration of the report generation process,
            and then destroy it automatically when it is no longer needed by the reporting engine.

# OpenClientDataSource Component Overview

OpenClient data source is a component dedicated to feed report data items from OpenEdge AppServer ABL procedures. In order to communicate with the AppServer the data source component uses Open Client.NET proxy class library that is generated using the OpenEdge.NET Proxy Generator tool.       

## Supported ABL Procedures

In order to be suitable for reporting purpose the ABL procedure has to have the following properties:

* The procedure should not be nested

* The data should be returned as OUTPUT or INPUT-OUTPUT parameter of type DATASET or DATATABLE

* In order to have data schema while designing reports it is recommended to specify schema for the DATASET/DATATABLE

## Supported developer platforms

*.NET Framework 4.0 and above

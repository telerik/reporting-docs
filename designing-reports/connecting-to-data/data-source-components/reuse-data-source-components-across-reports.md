# Reuse Data Source components across Reports

The article elaborates how to reuse a [Data Source component]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-source-components/overview%}) across multiple reports.       

## Reuse data source components across reports in Visual Studio

You can create a custom component, inheriting a Telerik Reporting Data Source component, that is configured with the desired settings.

1. From the Project menu select __Add__ -> __New Item__ 

1. In the __Add New Item__ dialog box, choose a __Component Class__  and click __Add__. The new file is added to the project and automatically opened in Visual Studio.

1. Change the base class from __Component__ to the appropriate Telerik Reporting Data Source component (Telerik.Reporting.SqlDataSource, Telerik.Reporting.ObjectDataSource, Telerik.Reporting.EntityDataSource, Telerik.Reporting.OpenAccessDataSource) as shown in the following code snippet:               
    
    ````cs
public partial class Component1 : Telerik.Reporting.SqlDataSource
````

    ````vb.net
Partial Class Component1
Inherits Telerik.Reporting.SqlDataSource
````

1. __Save__ and __rebuild__ the project.               

1. Right click the component class ->__View Designer__ 

1. Click __Configure data source__ 

1. Follow the wizard

1. __Save__ and __rebuild__ 

1. The Project Data Source is now listed under the __Project Data Sources__ node, if you run Project -> Add New Item -> Telerik Report [VERSION] Wizard. And the Prject Data Source is available in the Visual Studio Toolbox, if you open a report in the Visual Studio Report Designer.               

## Reuse data source components across reports in the Standalone Report Designer

The Standalone Report Designer can load data from external assemblies, which excludes custom data source components. For more details, check [Extending Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/configuration/extending-report-designer%}).         

Instead, you can create __templates__ with initial settings like configured data source components and layout elements - [Report Templates]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/report-templates%}).

# How to Connect to a SQL Server Database Using Stored Procedure



You can connect to a Microsoft SQL Server database using the Telerik       __SqlDataSource__ component. To do this, you need a connection string and access       rights to a SQL Server database. Then, you can use the SqlDataSource component       to provide data to data items (Report, Table, Chart).

## To connect to a SQL Server database using the SqlDataSource component

1. In Microsoft Visual Studio, open a Telerik Report. From the              Telerik Reporting {{site.suiteversion}} group in the Toolbox, select the              SqlDataSource component and click on the design surface to add it              to the Report.

1. __Choose your Data Connection__ dialog box appears.

1. Click __New Connection__ 

+ If the __Change Data Source__ dialog box appears, click 
            __Microsoft SQL Server__, and then click __Continue__.

1. In the __Add Connection__ dialog box,              click __Change__.

1. In the __Change Data Source__ dialog box, click Microsoft SQL Server,             and then click __OK__.

1. In the __Server name__ box, enter the name for your SQL Server database,             and then under __Logon to the server__, enter the logon credentials.

+ For the logon credentials, select the option that is appropriate for accessing and running the SQL Server database (either by using Microsoft Windows integrated security or by providing a specific ID and password) and, if it is required, enter a user name and password.

1. In the __Select or enter a database name__ list,             enter a valid database on the server e.g. __AdventureWorks__.

1. Optionally, click __Test connection__ to verify that your              connection works.

1. Click __OK__, Click __Next__            to continue and select __Yes, save this connectionâ€¦__.              Enter a name for your connection for when it is stored in the application              configuration file, and then click __Next.__ 

1. Select the stored procedure from which to retrieve results             e.g. __uspGetEmployeeManagers__ and click Next.

+ If the stored procedure has a parameter, the __Configure Data Source Parameters__ step shows. You can leave the sql parameter value              blank and continue, create an expression or create a report parameter             as values. Choosing the last option would give you ability to use the             built-in report parameters to specify value at run time. The              SqlDataSource component submits the text in the SelectCommand property             to the database, and the database returns the result of the stored              procedure back to the SqlDataSource component. Any data items that are              bound to the data source component would display the result set on your              report.

1. To test your query, click __Next__, and then              click __Execute Query__.

1. Click __Finish__. The Wizard would close              and the SqlDataSource component would be ready for use by the data              items.

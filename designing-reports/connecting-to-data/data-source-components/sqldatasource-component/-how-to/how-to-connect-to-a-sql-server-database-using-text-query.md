# How to Connect to a SQL Server Database Using Text Query



You can connect to a Microsoft SQL Server database using the Telerik       __SqlDataSource__ component. To do this, you need a connection string and access       rights to a SQL Server database. Then, you can use the SqlDataSource component       to provide data to data items (Report, Table, Chart).

## To connect to a SQL Server database using the SqlDataSource component

1. In Microsoft Visual Studio, open a Telerik Report. From the              Telerik Reporting {{site.suiteversion}} group in the Toolbox, select the              SqlDataSource component and click on the design surface to add it              to the Report.

1. __Choose your Data Connection__ dialog box appears.

1. Click __New Connection__ 

+ If the __Change Data Source__ dialog box appears, click 
            __Microsoft SQL Server__, and then click __Continue__.

1. In the __Add Connection__ dialog box,              click __Change__.

1. In the __Change Data Source__ dialog box, click Microsoft SQL Server,             and then click __OK__.

1. In the __Server name__ box, enter the name for your SQL Server database,             and then under __Logon to the server__, enter the logon credentials.

+ For the logon credentials, select the option that is appropriate for accessing and running the SQL Server database (either by using Microsoft Windows integrated security or by providing a specific ID and password) and, if it is required, enter a user name and password.

1. In the __Select or enter a database name__ list,             enter a valid database on the server e.g. __AdventureWorks__.

1. Optionally, click __Test connection__ to verify that your              connection works.

1. Click __OK__, Click __Next__            to continue and select __Yes, save this connectionâ€¦__.              Enter a name for your connection for when it is stored in the application              configuration file, and then click __Next.__ 

1. Select the database table or view from which to retrieve results or specify your own SQL statement.

1. To test your query, click __Next__, and then              click __Execute Query__.

1. Click __Finish__. The Wizard would close              and the SqlDataSource component would be ready for use by the data              items.

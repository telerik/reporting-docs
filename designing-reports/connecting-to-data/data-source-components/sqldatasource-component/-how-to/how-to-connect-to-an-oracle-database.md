# How to Connect to an Oracle Database



You can use the Telerik SqlDataSource component to connect to an Oracle         database. You connect the component to an Oracle database by first establishing         connection information in the config file, and then by referencing the         connection information in a SqlDataSource control.       

## To use the SqlDataSource control to connect to an Oracle database

1. In Microsoft Visual Studio, open a Telerik Report. From the               Telerik Reporting {{site.suiteversion}} group in the Toolbox, select the               SqlDataSource component and click on the design surface to add it               to the Report.             

1. __Choose your Data Connection__  dialog box               appears.             

1. Click __New Connection.__ 

1. In the __Add Connection__  dialog box,               click __Change__  to display the Change Data               Source dialog box.             

1. In the __Data source__  list, click Oracle               Database and then click __Ok__ .             

1. The __Add Connection__  dialog box is displayed. In the               __Server name__  box, type the name of the Oracle server.             

1. Type the user name and password to connect with the database.

1. Select __Save my password__  box to save               authentication information as part of the connection string, and               then click __OK__ .             

1. You are returned to the __Choose Your Data Connection__                dialog with the new connection string information displayed.             

1. Click __Next__  and Select the               __Yes, save this connectionâ€¦__  check box.               Enter a name for your connection for when the connection is stored               in the application configuration file, and then click __Next__ .             

1. Select the database table, view, or stored procedure from which               to retrieve results or specify your own SQL statement.             

1. To test your query, click __Next__ , and               then click __Execute Query__ .             

1. Click __Finish__ . The Wizard would close               and the SqlDataSource component would be ready for use by the data items

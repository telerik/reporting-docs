# How to Connect to a SQL Database

You can connect to a SQL database using the Telerik __SqlDataSource__  component. To do this, you need a valid.NET data provider, connection string and access rights to the SQL database. Then, you can use the SqlDataSource component to provide data to [data items (Report, Table, Graph, Map)]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-items/overview%}) and [report parameters]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/report-parameters/overview%}).       

## To connect to a SQL database using the SqlDataSource component

1. Open a Telerik Reporting in a [Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/overview%})

   + __In Microsoft Visual Studio__ : From the Telerik Reporting {{site.suiteversion}} group in the Toolbox, select the SqlDataSource component and click on the design surface to add it to the Report.                 

   + __In the Standalone Report Designer__ : Select *SQL Data Source*  from the *Data tab*.   
   
   The __SqlDataSource Wizard__ should be started automatically. For already existing SqlDataSource components in the report, select __'Configure...'__ from the component's Context Menu.             

1. __Choose Data Connection__  dialog box appears.             

1. Click __Build New Data Connection__ to add the connection string to the SQL database:             

    >The __Data provider__ drop-down lists the installed and registered on the machine.NET data providers. The.NET data provider determines the syntax of connection string, the syntax of SQL query, and what ADO.NET classes will be used by the SqlDataSource component to create a connection and to execute the SQL command. The.NET data provider must be considered with the type of the SQL database you intend to use.

   1. Open the __Data provider__ drop-down and select the.NET data provider suitable for the target SQL database.                 

   1. In the __Connection string__ text-box, type the prepared and tested connection string or click the __Build...__  button.  
   
     If you click the __Build...__ button, you should see the __Connection Properties__ dialog:                 

     + __Data source:__ shows the type of data source that will be used, based on the selected.NET data provider. The value should be filled automatically, if a valid.NET provider is set through the __Data provider__ drop-down.                     

     + __Data source box:__ Shows the type of data source that will be used, based on the selected.NET data provider.                     

     + __Server name box:__ Enter the address or name for your SQL Server instance.                     

     + __Logon to the server/database__ : Enter the logon credentials, or if it is supported by the.NET data provider, select to 'Use Windows Authentication'. Select the option that is appropriate for accessing and running the SQL Server database. The settings are turned into standard connection strings attributes. For more details, check  [The Connection Strings Reference](https://www.connectionstrings.com/).                     

     + __Select or enter a database name:__ The option depends on the selected.NET data provider and the required attributes for building the connection string. If the option is visible, enter a valid database on the server e.g. __AdventureWorks__ (MSSQL database used by Telerik Reporting local examples).  
   
     At the end, click __Test connection__ to verify that your connection works. Click __OK__. You should see the connection string's attributes written in the __Connection string__ text-box.                 

     >Not all connection strings can be built with the __Connection Properties__ dialog, and in such cases the __Build...__ button remains disbled. The connection string will have to be typed manually.                   
   
   
   For our tutorial we will connect to AdventureWorks database installed on MSSQL server instance:
	
   1. Select __Build new data connection__.                 

   1. Open the __Data provider__ drop-down and select __SqlClient Data Provider__.                 

   1. Click the __Build...__ button.                 

     + __Data source__ should state *Microsoft SQL Server (SqlClient)*. Do not change it.                     

     + In the __Server name box__ select the named MSSQL server instance having the AdventureWorks database e.g. __(local)\sqlexpress__.                     

     + Select __Use Windows Authentication__ for the __Logon to the server__ setting. In case of using specififc user to log on the MSSQL server instance, select *Use SQL Server Authentication* and enter your credentials (username/password).                     

     + Type *AdventureWorks*  in the __Select or enter a database name__ box.  
	 
	 Finally, click __Test Connection__ to verify you can connect to the database.                 

   1. Click the __OK__ button, and in the __Connection string__ text-box you should see a string like *Data Source=(local)\sqlexpress;Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks;Integrated Security=True* or *Data Source=(local)\sqlexpress;Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks;User ID=admin;Password=admin123* 

1. Click __Next__ to continue to the __Data Connection Options__ dialog. Where you can:     
        
   + Select __Use a shared connection__, which option saves the connection string by the name typed in the __Alias__ box, in the current project's CONFIG file, under the __connectionStrings element__. 
     
	 This will let you reuse the connection string for other SqlDataSource components. The Reporting Engine uses a [ConfigurationManager(msdn)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.configuration.configurationmanager(v=vs.110).aspx) to search connection strings by name in the current project's configuration file.                 

   + Select __Embed in the report definition__, which option saves the connection string the way it is written in the __Connection string__ text-box as __SqlDataSource.ConnectionString property__.   
   
   For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use the __Use a shared connection__ option. Type __AdventureWorksConnection__ as *Alias*.  
   
   Click __Next__.             

1. Follows the __Configure data source command__ dialog.       
      
   + __Select Statement:__ Use this option to type a standard SQL query. You can use the __Query Builder__ button to design the SQL query through the available UI.  
   
     The Visual Studio Report Designer uses the IDE's Query Builder, where the Standalone Report Designer uses its own implementation of a [Query Builder]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-source-wizards/sqldatasource-wizard/query-designer-in-the-standalone-designer%}).                 

   + __Stored Procedure:__ Use this option to select a stored procedure existing in the connected SQL database. If the stored procedure is not discovered, you can type its name manually e.g. *dbo.GetNotes*.     
   
   In this tutorial we will use the __Select Statement__ option. Type the following SQL query:  
   
   SELECT * FROM [HumanResources].[Department] WHERE [HumanResources].[Department].[DepartmentID]=@ID

   >If the SQL query returns more than one set of data, only the first result will be used.Test running the SQL query on the SQL server database to verify the syntax.

1. If the entered SQL query contains SQL parameters, recognizable by the.NET data provider, clicking the Next button will navigate you to the __Configure data source parameters__ step. You should see listed the recognized SQL parameters and their DbType in a grid. In the Value column you can specify static value, report parameter, field, or other expression which once evaluated will be passed to the SQL query.  

   In this tutorial we use a parameterized SQL query and you should see the __Configure data source parameters__ window of the wizard. There must be one row in the grid:    
   
   + __Name__ showing the SQL parameter's name, written in TSQL: __@ID__;                 

   + __DbType__ showing the SQL parameter's discovered type: __String__ (if no other specified). Change it to Int64 that can be mapped by an Integer report parameter.                 

   + Click the cell under the __Value__ column and select the *New Report Parameter*  option. In the [Report Parameter Editor]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/reportparameter-collection-editor%}) will be loaded default information about the newly created report parameter, where you can set __Type=Integer__ and __Visible=True__. Click __OK__ to confirm the changes and to create the report parameter. 
   
   Click __Next__ to navigate to the __Configure design time parameters__ step. Enter design-time (constant) value to evaluate the SQL query and get the data fields in the Report Designer e.g. type __1__. 
   
   Click __Next__.             

1. To test your query, click __Next__, and then click __Execute Query__ in the __Preview data source results__ step of the wizard.             

1. Click __Finish__. The SqlDataSource Wizard would close and the SqlDataSource component would be ready for use by the data items.

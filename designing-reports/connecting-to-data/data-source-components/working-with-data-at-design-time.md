# Working With Data at Design Time



The [Visual Studio Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/overview%}) would show data source related information      	(incl. data source schema) when a valid data source is available at design time. As the __Report Designer__  works        	inside __Visual Studio__ , a valid data source means: 		 

* A data source object that is instantiated and initialized in the InitializeComponent() method of  	the designed object class - this is the only part of the class that __Visual Studio__  designer respects.

* The data source object should be operational at design time. This means that Visual Studio (through the[Visual Studio Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/overview%})

##       	With the above in mind, there are two cases:
 	 

##Data source available at design time

The __Data Source Components__  designed and developed specifically for __Telerik Reports__ ,       	overcome most of the design time issues while providing the freedom to connect [Data Items]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-items/overview%}) to a wide variety of data sources incl. databases,        	OR/mappers, Analysis Services' Cubes, etc. without requiring code. Data source components can only read the data and cannot modify it. Every data source component is an instance of the  [DataSource](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.DataSource)  class.         Having valid data source attached to [Data Source Components]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-source-components/overview%}) at design time allows you to take advantage         of all design time goodness and work with the [Data Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-explorer%}).          For more information please see [Data Source Components]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-source-components/overview%}) and [DataSource Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-source-wizards/datasource-wizard%}).               	

##Data source available only at runtime

This approach is useful when you cannot get the report's data source at design time or want to avoid loading real data               		into __Visual Studio__  at design time. In this case you would have to mock your data just to       	enable the __Report Designer__  to show any data schema. This will enable you to adjust the layout of the report          and bind report items to the available data fields, while the real data will be loaded only at runtime either in          [NeedDataSource event]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-items/using-the-needdatasource-event-to-connect-data%}) or in the actual application.

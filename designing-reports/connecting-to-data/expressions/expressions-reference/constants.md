# Constants



## Built-in constants

__False__ ,           __True__ , __null__ .         

## Literal text

In an expression, literal           text is text that is enclosed in single or double quotation marks.         

Example:

	
          ="Product name: " + Fields.ProductName
        



or

	
          ='Product name: ' + Fields.ProductName
        



>note Because quotation marks are special characters inside the literal             text, you need to double the quotation mark to escape it. Other option is to use the other quotation marks as literal             delimiters (then our quotation mark will not be a special symbol).             The following table shows some examples of quotation mark combinations in an expression and their result:           


| Expression | Result |
| ------ | ------ |
|'It''s my birthday'|It's my birthday|
|"It""s my birthday"|It"s my birthday|
|'It"s my birthday'|It"s my birthday|
|"It's my birthday"|It's my birthda|





Some report item properties allow the usage of           [             Embedded             Expressions           ]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/embedded-expressions%}), which provide easy concatenation of string literals           with expression terms.         

## Numeric constants

They are resolved to:

*  __Integer__  if decimal point is not used - for example 1, 256, 65000

*  __Decimal__  if decimal point is used - for example 1.0, 25.6

Example:

	= Fields.LineTotal  < 100



## Date-time constants

Date values should           be enclosed within pound signs (#).         

Example:

	=Fields.Birthdate < #1/31/82#

# Accessing Members

When you write an expression, you have access not only to [Global Objects]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/expressions-reference/global-objects%}), [Functions]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/expressions-reference/functions/overview%}) and [Aggregate Functions]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/expressions-reference/functions/aggregate-functions%}) but you can also access a member of an object, using the `.` (dot) character. You can call all public members of an object directly in the Expression Editor. Here are a few examples:

* `= Now().ToShortDateString():` Returns a string that contains the current date in short format.
* `= 'abc'.ToUpper():` Returns "ABC" string.
* `= 'abc'.Length:` Returns the length of the current string, 3.
* `= Price.ToString('$0.'):` Returns the value of Price formatted according to the specified format, i.e. $123

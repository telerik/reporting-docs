# Expressions Reference Overview



Expressions are written in Telerik Reporting scripting language.         The language is based on mathematical expressions, and is case insensitive.

When you write an expression, you have access to many built-in fields,         collections, and functions that you can use alone or combine with other         terms. You can add function calls, operators, constants, fields, parameters,         items from the built-in collections to an expression. Built-in function         calls include aggregation, commonly used utility functions, and conversion         methods. You can also add references to functions defined in your code         (see [user functions]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/extending-expressions/user-functions%})).

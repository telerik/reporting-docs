# Extending Expressions Overview

Expressions can easily be extended by providing user functions written in any .NET language. This is very useful in addition to the built-in functions, providing more complex domain-specific calculations or uniform calculations because it speeds up the processing and boosts the performance. Furthermore, you can add custom aggregate functions to apply domain-specific logic while accumulating values.

In order to expose your custom functions, so they can be utilized by the Reporting engine, you have to add a reference to the assembly they are defined in. This can be done through the [assemblyReferences element]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/export-and-configure/configure-the-report-engine/assemblyreferences-elementAssemblyReferences%}) in the application's configuration file.

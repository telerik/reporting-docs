# Extending Expressions Overview



Expressions can easily be extended by providing user functions written in any .NET language.       This is very useful in addition to the built-in functions, providing more complex domain-specific calculations        or for uniform calculations because it speeds up the processing and boosts the performance.       Furthermore, you can add custom aggregate functions to apply domain-specific logic while accumulating values.

In order to expose your custom functions, so they can be utilized by the Reporting engine,       you have to add a reference to the assembly they are defined in.        The reference is added under the AssemblyReferences configuration section in the application's configuration file.       

	
````XML
      <configuration>
			<configSections>
				<section
				    name="Telerik.Reporting"
				    type="Telerik.Reporting.Configuration.ReportingConfigurationSection, Telerik.Reporting"
				    allowLocation="true"
				    allowDefinition="Everywhere"/>
		    </configSections>
		    â€¦
		     <Telerik.Reporting>
				<AssemblyReferences>
					<add name="MyCustomAssembly" version="1.0.0.0" />
				</AssemblyReferences>
			 </Telerik.Reporting>
      </configuration>

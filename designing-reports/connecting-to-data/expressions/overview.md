# Expressions Overview



Expressions are widely used while designing reports, for example to         retrieve, calculate, display, group, sort, filter, and parameterize the         data in a report. Expressions provide great flexibility to control the         content, style, and behavior of your reports. Expressions use the Telerik         Reporting's built-in scripting language and are saved in the report         definition. When the report runs, the report processor evaluates the         expressions and substitutes the expression results for the property values.

To see evaluated expression values in a report, preview the report.

Parameters can be used with expressions to provide additional         flexibility for changing the content and appearance of a report.

Expressions begin with an equal (=) and can include a combination         of constants, operators, and references to built-in values (fields, parameters,         and functions), and to external or custom code.

>important The Expressions cannot begin with whitespace. The expression ' =Fields.Data', will be interpreted as a hardcoded string.           The correct value is '=Fields.Data'.         

>important Expressions are case-insensitive. Thus, it is strongly recommended that the data fields, functions,           and other objects used in expressions throughout the report are case-insensitive unique. Otherwise,            the expression engine will not be able to distinguish between the objects which may lead to unexpected results.         

During the evaluation, all defined operations and functions are         executed and all built-in objects are replaced with the real data according         to the current scope and a single value is returned. The type of the         result depends on the expression and should always conform to the property         it is applied to.

For example, if you create an expression for the __Style.BackgroundColor__          property, the value must evaluate to a System.Drawing.Color object.

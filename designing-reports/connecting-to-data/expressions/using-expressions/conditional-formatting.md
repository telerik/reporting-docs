# Conditional Formatting Overview

You can design a report so that different styles are applied to items based on the data in the report. For example, you can display negative numbers in red or change the background colors on a table cell.

To make styles conditional, use an expression instead of a static value for the style properties of the report item. The two examples below demonstrate how to make a __TextBox__ render negative values in red for a field called Profit. You can achieve this with the __Conditional Formatting Editor__ in Report Designer or by using [Bindings]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/bindings%}).

### Using Conditional Formatting Editor

1. In Report Designer, right-click on a __Text Box__ report item.
1. In the context menu, select __Conditional Formating__.
1. The [__Conditional Formatting Rules...__]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/conditional-formatting-rules-dialog%}) dialog appears on the screen.
1. Enter the conditional expression:

	`=Fields.Profit`

1. Enter the operator:

	`<`

1. Enter the value expression:

	`=0`

1. In the __Edit Style__ dialog select Red color for the Background.

### Using Bindings

1. To use Bindings, we need to implement a helper User Function:

	````C#
public static Color ColorFromName(string colorName)
	{
		if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(colorName))
		{
			return Color.FromName(colorName);
		}
		return Color.Transparent;
	}
````
	````VB.NET
Public Shared Function ColorFromName(ByVal colorName As String) As Color
		If Not String.IsNullOrEmpty(colorName) Then
			Return Color.FromName(colorName)
		End If
		Return Color.Transparent
	End Function
````


1. In the __Bindings Editor__ select the __Style.BackGroundColor__ property.
1. Enter the next expression:

	`=If(Fields.Profit < 0, ColorFromName("Red"), ColorFromName("White"))`

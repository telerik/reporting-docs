# Using Expressions Overview

This document provides a brief overview of all topics that we cover in the *Using Expressions* documentation section. With Telerik Reporting, you can use expressions to control multiple aspects of a report such as:       

* The content           

* The style and appearance           

* The behavior           

The following approaches allow you to control these report aspects:       

## Use an expression as a value for an item’s property

You can use an [expression as a value for an item’s property]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/expressions-as-values-of-item-properties%}). This allows you to easily customize your report.         

## Embed expressions in a string literal

Another way to customize your report is to use [Embedded Expressions]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/embedded-expressions%}) so that you can blend text with expressions.         

## Bind an expression to a report item property

Telerik Reporting allows you to [bind a report item’s property to an expression]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/bindings%}). Use this approach if the property that you are interested in doesn’t support expression values by default.         

## Use conditional formatting to apply various report styles

Design your reports so that [different styles are applied]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/conditional-formatting%}) based on the data in the report. This is possible when you use an expression instead of a static value for the style properties of a report item.         

## Use expressions as criteria for grouping, filtering, and sorting

You can write expressions and use them to [group, filter, or sort data]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/grouping,-filtering-and-sorting%}).         

## Combine values from multiple columns and use them as parameter values

You can use an expression to combine values from multiple columns and use the result as [a value or a label for a parameter]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/grouping,-filtering-and-sorting%}).

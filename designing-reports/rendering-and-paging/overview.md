# Rendering and Paging Overview

Telerik Reporting includes a set of rendering extensions (also referred to as renderers) for exporting reports to different formats. Each renderer applies set of rules when rendering reports. When exporting a report to file formats such as PDF which uses pagination based on physical page size, you might need to alter the layout of the report, so the exported report looks and prints correctly after the rules for the specific rendering extension are applied. 

Getting satisfactory results for exported reports is often a continuous and repetative process; you create and preview the report in Report Designer, export the report to the preferred format, review the exported report, and then make changes to the report back in the Report Designer. 

## Rendering extensions

Telerik Reporting includes a set of renderers that you can use to export reports to different formats. By default Telerik Reporting outputs reports in the following formats: Image, PDF, HTML5, MHTML, Excel 97-2003, XLSX, PPTX, DOCX, RTF, XAML and CSV.

|IMAGE|Renders a report in image format with [physical page layout]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/interactive-vs.-print-layout%}). The format is shown as TIFF in the Export drop-down of the Report Viewers toolbar.|

All __Telerik Reporting__ output formats have specific characteristics that determine their usage and impose ceratin limitations, which need to be taken into consideration when designing reports. For example, the CSV rendering extension is useful for creating reports that can be used as a data source by another application or process, layout rendering extensions produce reports in a format suitable for viewing by users, while physical rendering extensions are intended for precise printing. 

For more information on the rendering extensions, refer to [Design Considerations for Report Rendering]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/rendering-and-paging/design-considerations-for-report-rendering/overview%})

## Rendering Behaviors

There are three types of renderers: 

* __Data__  renderers: CSV renderer. 

* __Logical__ page layout renderers: Excel (XLS and XLSX) and MHTML renderers. Rendering extensions IMAGEInteractive, HTML5Interactive, XAMLInteractive and WPFXAMLInteractive are for internal use by the Report Viewers in Interactive View. 

* __Physical__  page layout renderers: IMAGE, HTML5, XAML, WPFXAML, PDF, RTF, XPS, PPTX, DOCX renderers. Rendering extensions IMAGE, HTML5, XAML, WPFXAML are used by corresponding Report Viewers in Print Preview. 

Depending on the renderer you select, certain rules are applied when rendering the report. How report items fit together on a page is determined by the combination of these factors: 

* Rendering rules.

* The width and height of report items.

* The size of the report.

* The width and height of the page.

* Renderer-specific support for paging.

For example, reports rendered with IMAGEInteractive and HTML5Interactive formats are optimized for a computer screen-based experience where pages can be various lengths. For more information, see [Understanding Rendering Behaviors]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/rendering-and-paging/understanding-rendering-behaviors%}). 

## Pagination

Pagination refers to the number of pages within a report and how report items are arranged on these pages. Pagination varies depending on the used renderer, page break and keep-together options you configure the report to use. 

A successfully designed report that is optimized for the renderer that you plan to use to deliver your report, requires understanding of the rules used to control pagination. Reports exported by using the data and logical rendering extensions are typically not affected by pagination. When you use a logical rendering extension such as the HTML rendering extension, you might want to know how the report looks printed and also how well it renders using a physical page renderer such as PDF. You can use the Preview in the Report Designer and export the report to easily get an idea how the report looks in the different layouts. 

The physical page renderers impact the report layout and physical page size most. To learn more, see [Understanding Pagination]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/rendering-and-paging/understanding-pagination%}).

# How to Create a Report Book at Runtime

You can programmatically create a report book at runtime by using the Telerik Reporting API.

The following steps are required to create a report book at runtime:

1. Create an instance of the ReportBook class
1. Add the necessary ReportSources to its `ReportSources` collection.

Alternatively, you can derive from the ReportBook class and initialize the book in the constructor if you want to separate the report book implementation details from the rest of your code.

In the sample below we add two reports:

1. First is the 'WeekdayReport', which is a CS/VB class inheriting from Telerik.Reporting.Report. It is added as a `TypeReportSource` - check [Available ReportSources]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-sources/overview%}).
1. Second is the 'Glossary.trdp' report created with the Standalone Designer. It is added wrapped in a `UriReportSource`. You need to specify the relative or full path to the TRDP file:

{{source=CodeSnippets\CS\API\Telerik\Reporting\ReportBookSnippets.cs region=CreateReportBook}}
{{source=CodeSnippets\VB\API\Telerik\Reporting\ReportBookSnippets.vb region=CreateReportBook}}

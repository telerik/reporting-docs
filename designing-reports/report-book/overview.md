# Overview



The main goal of a report book is combining different reports into one for the purposes of printing         them at once or exporting them to a single file. Reports are displayed in the order they were added to the         report book, each report starting on a new page.       

## Why to use a ReportBook:

* You need to combine multiple reports into a single document for preview, print and export;

* You need to combine multiple instances of the same report with different settings into a single document for preview, print and export;

* You need each report to start on a new physical page, sheet in Excel Workbook;

* You need each report to have different [page settings]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/rendering-and-paging/understanding-pagination%}) like page size and orientation;             

## What is a ReportBook

A Report Book is a class inheriting *Telerik.Reporting.ReportBook* .           The ReportBook.ReportSources collection allows you to add reports of different formats           (XML, TRDX and TRDP files, run-time instances or classes inheriting *Telerik.Reporting.Report* ) into the book,           where the Reporting Engine knows how to process the separate reports based on the type of the           used [Report Source]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-sources/overview%}) for adding them.         

>note Note that  __Instance__  and  __XML__  Report Sources cannot be used with the ReportBook.           


The  [Report Book online demo](https://demos.telerik.com/reporting/report-book)  is available also in the local Examples installed by default under *...Progress\Telerik Reporting R3 2021\Examples* .           An example how to create a ReportBook instance at run-time can be found in [How to: Create a Report Book at run-time]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-book/how-to-create-a-report-book-at-run-time%}).

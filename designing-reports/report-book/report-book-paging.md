# Report Book Paging


## Report Book Paging

Reports are displayed in the order they were added to the report book, each report starting on a new page. The way pages are counted (the evaluation of the 'PageNumber' global object) may be different in the context of a report book compared to counting pages in a single report. The Report class has a property of type __PageNumberingStyle__ that will let you control the behavior of page counting in the context of a report book.

>note The  __PageNumberingStyle__  property has meaning and effect only when the report is part of a report book.


The PageNumberingStyle enumeration has three values with self-explanatory names. "ResetNumbering" resets page numbering while page count aggregation continues, ResetNumberingAndCount resets both page numbering and page count and "Continue" indicates that both page numbering and page count aggregations continue from where the previous report in the book has left off. The default value of this property is "Continue". Below is a small example of how to use the PageNumberingStyle assuming that each of the three reports has a total of two pages:

__The value of the TextBox in the PageHeader is equal to = "Page: " + PageNumber + " of " + PageCount__ 
>caption PageNumberingStyle.Continue

## Multiple PageNumberingStyles and Reports order

When working with the `PageNumberingStyle` property, if the Reports have different values set for that property, the order of reports will matter for the values of the `PageNumber` and `PageCount` objects.

For example, if there is a Report Book of two reports - `Report1.trdp` that uses `PageNumberingStyle.ResetNumberingAndCount` and `Report2` that uses `PageNumberingStyle.Continue`, and the order of the reports is the following:

- Report1.trdp - 5 total pages
- Report2.trdp - 1 total page

In such a case, when the total page count is being counted and the reporting engine goes to the second report, since it uses `PageNumberingStyle.Continue`, the total `PageCount` will be added to that of the `Report1.trdp` report and if it has a total of _5 pages_, and `Report2.trdp` is one page, the `PageCount` object will return `6` for both reports(only when rendered in the context of a Report Book).

On the other hand, if the order of the two reports is switched and now `Report2.trdp` is first, since the next report(`Report1.trdp`) uses `PageNumberingStyle.ResetNumberingAndCount`, when the counting gets to it the `PageCount` will be restarted and it will now return the total page count of `5`.

# Standalone Report Designer Configuration Sections

The settings of the Telerik Reporting engine are defined in a custom configuration section called `Telerik.Reporting`. This section should be added to the Report Designer configuration file `Telerik.ReportDesigner.exe.config`: 

````XML
<configuration>
	<configSections>
		<section
			name="Telerik.Reporting"
			type="Telerik.Reporting.Configuration.ReportingConfigurationSection, Telerik.Reporting"
			allowLocation="true"
			allowDefinition="Everywhere"/>
	</configSections>
	...
</configuration>
````

Using this section, you can control particular aspects of the engine such as the available rendering extensions and the cache management system which is utilized by the viewers. For more information, see [Telerik Reporting Configuration Section]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/export-and-configure/configure-the-report-engine/overview%}).

The Telerik Report Designer offers additional configuration through its own custom configuration section, called `Telerik.ReportDesigner`:

````XML
<configuration>
	<configSections>
		<section
					name="Telerik.ReportDesigner"
					type="Telerik.ReportDesigner.Configuration.ReportDesignerConfigurationSection, Telerik.ReportDesigner.Configuration"
					allowLocation="true"
					allowDefinition="Everywhere"/>
	</configSections>
	...
</configuration>
````

This section lets you specify the working directory of the Report Designer via a single attribute:

````XML
<Telerik.ReportDesigner DefaultWorkingDir="Examples">
</Telerik.ReportDesigner>
````

# Working with Report Server Reports



Standalone Report Designer is integrated with Telerik Report Server         so you can create, open, lock, save, save as, publish and revert report changes

## Overview

When you lock a report on a Report Server, you ensure that others cannot make changes to the report while you edit it.           While the report is locked, you can edit the report, close it, reopen it, and even work with the report on your hard disk.           Other users cannot change the report or see your changes until you publish the report.         

Locking reports before working on them helps to avoid conflicts and confusion when multiple people are working on the same set of reports.           When a report is locked to you, only you can make changes to it. You can lock any report on a Report Server for which you have permission,           and you can lock reports directly from the Standalone Report Designer.         

When you make changes to the report, the report is locked automatically and the changes are stored on your hard disk in the windows temporary folder.           When the report is saved the changes are saved on the server but your changes are still not visible to the other users.           You must publish the report before others can see your changes.         

When you publish a report, you can type comments about the changes that you made to the report.             This helps people to understand what has changed in the report from version to version.             This is especially helpful if several people work on a report or if the report is likely to go through several revisions.             Your comments become a part of the version history of the report, which can be helpful if people need to view or revert to a previous version.           

While a report is locked to you, the changes that you make are not visible to others until you publish the report.           There may be situations in which you want to publish the report so that others can see your changes,           but you want to keep the report locked so that you can continue working on it.         

When a report server report is opened, the Server ribbon tab is activated to provide commands to lock, publish and revert changes.

# SqlDataSource Wizard Overview



The __SQL Data Source Wizard__  allows you to create a new or edit an existing __SqlDataSource__  component based on a __SQL__  select statement or a database stored         procedure. After the wizard appears you have to perform the following steps:       

## 

1. __Choose data connection__ Choose an existing connection from the list of connections or specify a new connection.               All local, server (if connected to Report Server) and Server Explorer (for Visual Studio) connections are listed.             Server Explorer connection will not be listed if it is having the same connection string alias as a local one.               If you choose a Server Explorer connection, you can save it as local or use it as embedded in the next step.             If you have connected Standalone Report Designer to a Report Server you can see the server connections in this list.               Server report can use only server connections and a local report can use only local connections.               If you choose a connection from another source it will be used as base for a new connection that you               can save or use as embedded in the next step.             For report server report the user need create permission for data connections                to see other sources connections and to add a new connection.             

1. __Data connection options__ For server reports this page is skipped when an existing report server connection is used.Choose *"Use as shared connection"*  to store the connection               string in the application configuration file under a specific name or use the connection from the shared store.                What is the exact action is described in the radio button description below.               The second option *"Embedded in the report definition"*  will save the connection string in the               report definition. Thus it will be available only for this report and will be available no matter the report definition location.             For new server reports embedded connections option is not allowed.             

   >note Saving connection strings in the application configuration file (or application store for connections)                  simplifies the process of maintaining your                 application if the database connection changes. In the event of a change in the database connection you can                 edit the connection string in the application store (configuration) as opposed to editing all the report definition and                 having to recompile your application. However if you want to render the report definition in the context of another                 project or application you have to make sure that connection string with the same name is available in the                 application and have access to the database.               

1. __Configure Data Source Command__ Choose whether you want to base your __SqlDataSource__  on a __SQL__                select statement or a stored procedure:             

   + Choosing the *"Select Statement"*  option allows you to enter a __SQL__  query statement directly in the text box below. Alternatively you can click *"Query Builder"*  to invoke the Visual Studio __Query Builder__  dialog.                   In the context of the [Standalone Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/overview%}) the button will invoke the                   [Query Designer in the Standalone Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-source-wizards/sqldatasource-wizard/query-designer-in-the-standalone-designer%}). Both are user-friendly interfaces for building __SQL__  queries.                 

   + Choosing the *"Stored Procedure"*  option allows you to select the name of an                   existing database stored procedure from the drop-down list below which is responsible for the data retrieval.                 

1. __Configure Data Source Parameters__ Specify the parameters for the __SQL__  query or stored procedure. Click *"New"*  to add a new parameter to the __SqlDataSource__  component or               *"Delete"*  to remove an existing parameter. Use the arrow buttons to change the               order of the parameters when necessary.             

   + Specify a valid name for each data source parameter in the *"Name"*  column.                   You can also choose that name from the list of existing parameter names which are derived directly from                   the __SQL__  query statement or stored procedure.                 

   + Choose the appropriate database type for the parameter in the *"DbType"*  column.                   This type should match exactly the type of the expression in the __SQL__  query statement                   or the type of the parameter from the stored procedure.                 

   + Specify a default value for the parameter in the *"Value"*  column or bind it via                   an expression.                 

   >note You can bind a data source parameter directly to a report parameter. This way you can use the standard                 report parameter user interface to provide values for your data source parameters. The drop-down list                 of the  *"Value"*  column displays all existing report parameters. You can                 create a new report parameter by choosing  *```<New Report Parameter>```*                  from the list. Alternatively you can invoke the  __Edit Expression__  dialog by choosing                  *```<Expression>```*  from the list. This allows you to specify an arbitrary                 expression to evaluate for the parameter value.               

1. __Configure Design Time Parameters__ This step allows you to specify a value for each data source parameter that can be used at design time to               retrieve the schema of the __SqlDataSource__  component. At design time there is no expression context, so expressions are not supported and the values must be constant.             

   >note Specifying design time values for the parameters is necessary because the designer might need to execute the                  __SQL__  query or stored procedure of the data source in order to populate the schema                 displayed in the  __Data Explorer__  tool window and the  __Edit Expression__  dialog. These values do not affect the execution of the  __SQL__  query at                 runtime however.               

1. __Preview Data Source Results__ You can preview the result set returned by the __SqlDataSource__  before completing the               wizard. Click *Execute Query*  to execute the __SQL__  query               or stored procedure and display the retrieved data.             If the data source has parameters, the wizard displays a popup dialog before each preview, which allows you               to enter the parameter values.             This is the last step of the wizard. After pressing *"Finish"*  the wizard will               configure the __SqlDataSource__  component with the specified settings and close.

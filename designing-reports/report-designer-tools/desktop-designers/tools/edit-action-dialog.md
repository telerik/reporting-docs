# Edit Action Dialog

The Action dialog box can be used to enable interactive actions for all items that support interactivity: TextBox, Table/List/Crosstab, SubReport, PictureBox, Checkbox, Shape, Barcode, Panel, HtmlTextBox, Graph, Map, Choropleth. The Graph, Map and Choropleth items support interactivity on element level like series. 

Define an action so that a user can click on the report and link to a URL, to a different report, to a different location in the same report or toggle the visibility of items. 

The __Edit Action__ offers the following choices: 

* None             

* Sorting             

* Navigate to Report             

* Navigate to URL             

* Navigate to Bookmark             

* Toggle Visibility             

* Custom

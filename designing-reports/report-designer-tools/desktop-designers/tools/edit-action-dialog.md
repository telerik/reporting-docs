# Edit Action Dialog



The Action dialog box can be used to enable interactive actions for all items that support interactivity:         TextBox, Table/List/Crosstab, SubReport, PictureBox, Checkbox, Shape, Barcode, Panel, HtmlTextBox, Graph, Map, Choropleth.         The Graph, Map and Choropleth items support interactivity on element level like series.       

Define an action so that a user can click on the report and link to a URL, to a different report, to a different         location in the same report or toggle the visibility of items.       

## 

The __Edit Action__  offers the following choices:         

* None             

* Sorting             

* Navigate to Report             

* Navigate to URL             

* Navigate to Bookmark             

* Toggle Visibility             

* Custom

# Edit Calculated Fields Dialog of the Report Designer

Calculated fields can be used to create new values that do not exist in the data source. For example, a calculated field can represent a new value, a constant, an expression value, user defined function or even a report parameter, or an existing field that is converted to a different datatype.

## Add a Calculated Field

You specify a calculated field manually by creating an expression. The Edit Calculated Fields dialog is available in the property grid of our DataSource components:

* [SqlDataSource]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-source-components/sqldatasource-component/overview%})
* [ObjectDataSource]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-source-components/objectdatasource-component/overview%})
* [EntityDataSource]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-source-wizards/entitydatasource-wizard%})
* [OpenAccessDataSource]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-source-wizards/openaccessdatasource-wizard%})

by clicking on the ellipsis of the __CalculatedFields__ property.

# Edit Expression Dialog



The __Edit Expression__  dialog allows you to         dynamically produce a value for a report item in place of a hard coded          value. The Edit Expression dialog provides a list of predefined and          dynamic elements that can be used in your expression. A list of expression         element categories is located in the lower left hand list of the dialog,          the elements for each category are located in the lower middle of the dialog,         and descriptions are displayed in the lower right hand of the dialog.

To use the Edit Expression dialog either type an expression in directly  or double click the list of elements in the bottom middle list to add them to  the expression. In the figure below an expression with two database Fields  multiplied provide an extended price value. For a list of the supported  expression elements see [Using Item Binding Expressions]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/overview%}).

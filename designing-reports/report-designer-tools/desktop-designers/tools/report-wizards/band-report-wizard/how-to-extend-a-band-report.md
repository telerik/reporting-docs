# How to extend a Band Report



This topic will extend the example [Creating a Simple Report]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/band-report-wizard/how-to-use-the-report-wizard-to-create-a-band-report%}) to show several unique Telerik Reporting features including:       

* In Place Editing.

* Copying and pasting styles.

* Conditional formatting.

* Navigating and sizing report items.

* Resizing report sections.

* Adding Text, Shape and PictureBox report items to the report designer.

* Using the Data Explorer.

* Using the Report Explorer.

Use the report design created in [Creating a Simple Report]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/band-report-wizard/how-to-use-the-report-wizard-to-create-a-band-report%}) as a starting point.       

1. Double click the "ProductList" TextBox report item in the report header. This will activate             the "in place" editor, allowing you to enter text right in the designer without having to find the             appropriate property in the Property Window. Add a space so the TextBox reads "Product List".

1. __Zoom__  to 150% from the __Zoom Combo Box__              in the lower left corner of the design surface.           

   + For [Visual Studio Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/overview%}):               From the __ToolBox__  window drag a __TextBox__  item to the report                 header just to the right of the "Quantity" column. While dragging the TextBox, the                 __Snap Lines__  will aid you in positioning it so it aligns                 nicely with its neighbors.                 

  ![](images/QuickStart023.png)

   + For [Standalone Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/overview%}):               Select the target [report section]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/overview%}) and from the Insert tab click on the TextBox item.                 The TextBox item is added to the selected report section and with dragging you can position the TextBox in the correct location.               Double-click the __TextBox__               and enter "Reorder".           

1. Select the "Quantity" TextBox and copy the style rule applied in the __StyleName__  property. Select the "Reorder" field and paste the style rule in its __StyleName__  property.           

1. In these next steps you define a circle Shape item that reacts to changes in the data             so that when inventory falls below 50% of the "reorder point" quantity the circle will be             filled in red.           Add a new __Shape__  item to the detail section just below the "Reorder"             column. In the __Properties__  window set the __Size.Width__              property to "0.1in" and the __Size.Height__  property to "0.1in". Right click the             __Shape__  item and select __Conditional Formatting__              from the context menu.             

  ![](images/QuickStart025.png)

1. The __Conditional Formatting Rules__  dialog will display.           

   + Click the __New Rule__  button and a new row will be added in the grid.               

   + The __Edit Filters__  dialog will display on clicking in the Filters cell.                

   + Click the __New__  button to create a rule. Use the drop down lists to set                  __Expression__  to Fields.Quantity, __Operator__                   to "<" and __Value__  to "```<Expression>```". When you select                  "```<Expression>```" the __Edit Expression__  dialog displays.                  This dialog allows you to select from predefined data (i.e. constants, database fields, report parameters, etc.)                  and create an expression with them.               

   + Select __Fields__  from the list on the bottom right of the dialog.               

   + Double-click "ReorderPoint" from the bottom middle list to add it to the expression.               

   + Add to the expression at the top of the dialog so the complete expression reads "= Fields.ReorderPoint * .5". This rule will fire when the quantity of a product falls below half of the ReorderPoint value. Click __OK__  to close the __Edit Expression__  dialog.

   + On the __Conditional Formatting Rules__  dialog click the __Style__  button to display the __Style Builder__  dialog.               

   + Click __Background__  from the list on the left and select "Red" from the __Background Color__  drop down list.               

   + Click __OK__  to close the dialog.Click __OK__  twice more to close the remaining rule dialogs.

1. Press __F6__  to build the report.           

1. Click the __Preview__  button to display the report.             Scroll through the data and notice that the "Quantity" values that are below 50% of the             "Reorder point" are displayed in red.

1. The last set of steps to building this report design add an image item to the             report and format the page footer. These last steps also use the             [Data Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-explorer%})             and the [Report Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-explorer%}).           From the [Telerik Reporting menu]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/telerik-reporting-menu%})             select the [Data Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-explorer%}).             

  ![](images/QuickStart029.png)

1. Select the "ThumbNailPhoto" column from the             [Data Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/overview%})             list and drag it to the detail section of the report designer, just to the right of the "Reorder" column.             Notice that this step automatically creates a             [PictureBox]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/picturebox%}) report item.           

1. After dropping the ThumbNailPhoto the DetailSection will be automatically resized to             accommodate the entire PictureBox item:

1. The [Report Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-explorer%})             provides a hierarchical view of all the report sections and items in the report design. This allows             you to easily locate items that might otherwise be difficult to find in a visually complex report.           From the [               Telerik               Reporting menu             ]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/telerik-reporting-menu%}) select the [Report Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-explorer%}).           

1. Click "pageFooterSection1" to select the report page footer.           

1. In the __Properties__  window set the __Style.BackgroundColor__              property to "LightGray".

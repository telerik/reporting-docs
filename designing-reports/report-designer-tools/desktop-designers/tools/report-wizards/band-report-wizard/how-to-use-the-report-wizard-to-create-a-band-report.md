In this article we will discuss how to create a band layout report with the [Band Report Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/band-report-wizard/overview%}).

* The [DataSource Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-source-wizards/datasource-wizard%}) is started. Select the __[SqlDataSource Component]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-source-components/sqldatasource-component/overview%})__ icon and click the OK button.

   + Click the __Query Builder__ button. 

     >The Query Builder is part of Visual Studio and is available only in the [Visual Studio Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/overview%}). As of Telerik Reporting Q3 2014 SQL queries can be built in the Standalone Designer with the [Query Designer in the Standalone Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-source-wizards/sqldatasource-wizard/query-designer-in-the-standalone-designer%}). If you are using the [Standalone Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/overview%}) use the following select query and click Next: 
    
      ````sql
SELECT Production.Product.Name, Production.Product.ProductNumber, Production.Product.ReorderPoint,
Production.ProductPhoto.ThumbNailPhoto, Production.ProductInventory.Quantity
FROM Production.Product
INNER JOIN Production.ProductInventory ON Production.Product.ProductID = Production.ProductInventory.ProductID
INNER JOIN Production.ProductProductPhoto ON Production.Product.ProductID = Production.ProductProductPhoto.ProductID
INNER JOIN Production.ProductPhoto ON Production.ProductProductPhoto.ProductPhotoID = Production.ProductPhoto.ProductPhotoID
````

     + In the __Add Table__ dialog select "Product", "ProductInventory", "ProductPhoto" and "ProductProductPhoto" from the list of tables. Note: You can hold down the control key and click each of the tables to select them all at one time. 
     
     + Click the __Add__ button to close the dialog. 
     
     + On the __Query Builder__ select the fields shown in the figure below. In the Product table select "Name", "ProductNumber" and "ReorderPoint". In ProductPhoto select the "ThumbNailPhoto" column. In the ProductInventory table select the "Quantity" column. 
     
     + Click the __OK__ button to close the dialog. 

   + The __Configure Data Source Command__ step would show the generated statement. Clicking the __Next__ button would lead you to the __Preview Data Source Results__ step, where you can preview the data. Click finish to return to the __Choose Data Source__ page of the Report Wizard. On the next page choose __Standard Report Type__ and click the __Next__ button. 

   >The [SqlDataSource Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-source-wizards/sqldatasource-wizard/overview%}) article provides additional steps how to use parameterized SQL query. 

* The __Design Data Layout__ page of the Report Wizard allows you to assign database fields to sections of the report. The Report Wizard automatically places and formats the database fields in the appropriate report sections. 

   + Select from the __Available Fields__ list on the left side of the page. 

   + Select "Name", "ProductNumber", "ReorderPoint" and "Quantity". 

   + After selecting each field, click the __Detail__ button to add those columns to the detail listing of the report. 

   + Click the __Next__ button. 

* On the __Choose Report Layout__ page of the Report Wizard unselect the __Adjust report items to fit available space__ checkbox. Click the __Next__ button. 

* On the __Choose Report Style__ page of the Report Wizard select "Civic" from the __Style Sheets__ list on the left side of the page. Notice the style changes in the Preview portion on the right side of the page. The initial report layout appears in the design view. 

   >Notice that the wizard has automatically provided:
   >
   > * Data bound fields in the detail section of the report.
   >
   > * Styled page and column titles.
   >
   > * A page footer with standard date and page number output.

* Click the Preview of the designer to view your report.

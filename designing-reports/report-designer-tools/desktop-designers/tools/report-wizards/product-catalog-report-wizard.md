# Product Catalog Report Wizard



Product catalogs are among the most useful business presentation documents and Telerik reporting provides a way to create such catalogs easy and quick.         The current walkthrough will explain how to generate product catalogs using the Product Catalog Template using only a report designer of your choice.       

The proposed product catalog template allows the items to be grouped in two-level group hierarchy, having each group displaying aggregate information         in its footer. The user can also make some adjustments to the design of the selected template layout, which will be applied when the wizard finishes.

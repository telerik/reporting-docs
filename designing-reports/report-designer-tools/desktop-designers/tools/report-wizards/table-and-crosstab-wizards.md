# Table and CrossTab Wizards

The Table and CrossTab Wizards are introduced as guide through the process of creating a Table or CrossTab for your reports. Their intuitive step by step instructions would get you going in no time as no previous experience is needed when using the wizards:

__Step 1:__ This is the welcome screen which appears once you drop a crosstab or table wizard item on the reporting design surface. 

__Step 2:__ Choose DataSource. 

This page lets you use an existing data source from a list of data sources or add new Data Source. If you choose to create new data source, click the Add New Data Source button to start the [Data Source Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-source-wizards/datasource-wizard%}). It will walk you through an additional set of steps and when finished will return you to the Table/CrossTab Wizard so you can continue. 

__Step 3:__ Arrange Fields (Table Wizard is on the right. It allows for adding columns only). 

__Step 4:__ Choose Layout. 

__Step 5:__ Choose Style and Finish the wizard.

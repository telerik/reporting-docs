# Style Builder Dialog



The Style Builder dialog lets you set Text, Background, Edges and Line Style for any given report item including sections and the report as a whole. The dialog is accessed through the __Style__ property ellipses button and is also used in [conditional formatting]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/styling-reports/conditional-formatting%}). The dialog lets you change several style elements at one time and see the result in the Preview pane at the bottom of the dialog.       

## 

To use the Style Builder dialog choose a style element from the list on the left of the dialog. Change style characteristics in the area to the right of the list. Click the __OK__  button to apply the style changes or the __Cancel __ to leave the previous style untouched.

>tip The Style Builder dialog loads a standard Color Palette and a list of System Colors. If reports will be displayed in a             Web Application,  please consider using the Color Palette instead of System Colors.

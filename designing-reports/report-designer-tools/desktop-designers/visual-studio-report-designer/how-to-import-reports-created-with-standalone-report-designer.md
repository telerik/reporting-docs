# Importing Reports Created with the Standalone or Web Report Designer

Should you need to import your existing reports created with the [Standalone Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/overview%}) our recommendation is to use the TRDX|TRDP converter available in the [Import Report Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/import-report-wizard%}).

The result will be a class inheriting `Telerik.Reporting.Report`, that can be loaded in Visual Studio Report Designer.

> In general, Telerik Reports are `Telerik.Reporting.Report` objects which can be serialized in `TRDX` files, or compressed `TRDP` files. The XML definition has a schema version that is updated in case of API changes in the released reporting functionality. It is important to use a version of Standalone Report Designer that matches the version of Telerik Reporting assemblies used to create the .NET report definition. For more information, please refer to [XML Report Definition]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/xml-report-definition%}) (*XML Schema Versioning* section). This guarantees that you are using the same version of Telerik Reporting engine to create and process reports.

# Importing Reports Created with the Standalone or Web Report Designer

Should you need to import your existing reports created with the [Standalone Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/overview%}) or [Web Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/web-report-designer/overview%}) our recommendation is to use the TRDX|TRDP converter available in the [Import Report Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/import-report-wizard%}).

The Names of Report Items, Sections, Groups, and Components are converted to Report properties during conversion to CS/VB type. For that reason they must comply with the [C# identifier naming rules and conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/identifier-names). The failure to meet these name requirements will result in an error like "Identifier '_ItemName_' is not valid".

The Standalone and Web Report Designers allow report item names to contain special symbols, like spaces, that may not be valid in C# names. You must ensure the Names of Report Items, Sections, Groups, and Components contain only allowed characters to avoid conversion problems.

The result will be a class inheriting `Telerik.Reporting.Report`, that can be loaded in [Visual Studio Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/overview%}).

> In general, Telerik Reports are `Telerik.Reporting.Report` objects that can be serialized in `TRDX` files, or compressed `TRDP` files. The XML definition has a schema version that is updated in case of API changes in the released reporting functionality. It is important to use a version of Standalone Report Designer that matches the version of Telerik Reporting assemblies used to create the .NET report definition. For more information, please refer to [XML Report Definition]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/xml-report-definition%}) (*XML Schema Versioning* section). This guarantees that you are using the same version of the Telerik Reporting engine to create and process reports.

# Telerik Reporting Menu



The __Telerik Reporting menu__  can be accessed whenever an area of the report designer is selected. From here you can call:       

* [Report Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-explorer%}) - allows you to see the structure of the report and to select any item in the report. This menu item is available only when you're in the context of the report designer.           

* [Data Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-explorer%}) - provides an overview of the database fields that are available to your report. This menu item is available only when you're in the context of the report designer.           

* [Upgrade Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/upgrade-wizard%}) - guides you through the process of upgrading the projects and files of the current open solution to a newer version of Telerik Reporting. This menu item is always available in the Telerik Reporting Menu.           

* [Group Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/group-explorer%}) - the Group Explorer is an aid to navigating report/table groups. The Group Explorer allows you to see the structure of the groups, to select them and change the respective Grouping, Sorting and Filtering. This menu item is available only when you're in the context of the report designer.           

The "[Upgrade Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/upgrade-wizard%})" option is always available, while the other options are available __only when__  you are editing a Telerik Report in the Report Designer.       

>caution If the report designer is opened, but still only the "[Upgrade Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/upgrade-wizard%})" is visible, make sure the Report Designer is the active window i.e. it has focus.

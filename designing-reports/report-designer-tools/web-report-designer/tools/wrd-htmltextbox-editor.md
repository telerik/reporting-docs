# Editing in HtmlTextBox

In [2024 Q1 (18.0.24.130)](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/reporting/release-history/progress-telerik-reporting-2024-q1-18-0-24-130) we replaced the plain-text editor for the `Value` property of the [HtmlTextBox item]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/htmltextbox/overview%}) with a [KendoUI Editor component](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/controls/editor/get-started). This lets the user have an instant visual feedback on how their HTML will look like in the rendered report.

The editor lets you easily add [Embedded Expressions in HtmlTextBox]({%slug htmltextbox_embedded_expressions%}) along with the static text. The content may be HTML-formatted as explained in the article [Styling and Formatting HtmlTextBox]({%slug htmltextbox_formatting_and_styling%}).

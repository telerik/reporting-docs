# Structure of Web Report Designer

You are expected to see the sample report and the first time a user loads the Web report designer, they will see the **onboarding guide** which walks you through the main tools in the designer:

1. **Design surface** - Represents the interactive design surface where you actually create and style your report.

2. **Components tray** - Contains all of the items that you can add to the report.

5. **Main menu** - At the top left, the menu allows you to open, save and interact with all of your reports on a global level along with the **Asset Manager** which is where you store all of your reports assets.

6. **Preview** - Represents a `Preview` button which shows you a pixel perfect rendering of what the report will look like:

7. **Search box** - At the top we have a global **Search box** which allows you to search the report instance for any property value, component data source, etc.:

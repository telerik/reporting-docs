# Chart (obsolete)

> The Chart item is now superseded by the more advanced [Graph]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/graph/overview%}) item. The Graph item is most often used for building powerful OLAP/Pivot charts. The Chart item is not supported in .NET Core projects and in projects deployed on Azure. 


The Chart report item is used to display a chart on a report. It is business-oriented item with a focus on development productivity and ease-of-use. It allows you to rapidly build appealing charts that represent data in a people-friendly manner.

You can bind the Chart item:

* From the Report Designer by setting its DataSource property

* By using its NeedDataSource event

When you are in the event, you should work with the processing chart item i.e.:

    
````C#
private void chart1_NeedDataSource(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    Telerik.Reporting.Processing.Chart procChart = (Telerik.Reporting.Processing.Chart)sender;
    procChart.DataSource = your_datasource;
}
````
````VB.NET
Private Sub chart1_NeedDataSource(sender As Object, e As System.EventArgs)
    Dim procChart As Telerik.Reporting.Processing.Chart = DirectCast(sender, Telerik.Reporting.Processing.Chart)
    procChart.DataSource = your_datasource
End Sub
````

The formatting of the Chart report item is managed by a large number of properties. To customize the Chart report item, right-click the chart and select Properties from the context menu to use the Chart Wizard.

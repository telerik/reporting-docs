# Series

A sequence of data points that represents individual measurements.

## Setting series style

The styles of the series items relate and affect each other in a hierarchical way. The relations among the styles are visually explained on the [Style resolving fallback algorithm diagram]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/graph/formatting-a-graph/style-resolving-fallback-algorithm%}) Data points, data point labels, legend marks and legend items declare their own style that inherits the series' style and the base series color. However, if these items have an explicitly set property, it will override the series' style property as explained in the [Style Inheritance and Overriding]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/styling-reports/style-inheritance-and-overriding%}) documentation article. 

The Area and the Line series have an additional pair of properties named respectively AreaStyle/LineStyle and ConditionalFormatting. They affect the way the series is drawn, defining the line color, style and width, and the background color for the Area Series. 

> For example, if the series DataPoints have its __Style.LineWidth__ property set to __5pt__, this will affect the line width of the DataPoint markers and the legend item marker. But if the legend item's __MarkStyle.LineWidth__ property is set to __2pt__, then the legend item marker will be drawn with 2pt wide line, because the series's style property will be overriden. 


## Formatting data points

Each data point has graphical representation in accordance with the selected chart type. Its styling can be set through the __DataPointStyle__ property and changed in runtime using the __DataPointConditionalFormatting__ property. In most cases, depending on the chart type, the shape of the data point can be changed as well using the [MarkerType](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.LineSeries#Telerik_Reporting_LineSeries_MarkerType)  enumeration. 

###To change the data point shape in a series where it's applicable: 

1. On the design surface, click on the series. The selected bar series properties are listed in the __Property Browser__. 

1. Locate the __MarkerType__ property in the __Data Point Marker__ section. If the property doesn't exist for the selected series (e.g. Bar/Column), the data point shape cannot be changed.

1. Set the type of the marker from the drop-down menu. Set the __MarkerSize__ properties if necessary. 

    >Note that only the marker types that form a closed contour support __BackgroundImage__. The markers that consists only of lines (i.e. __X__, __Plus__, __Minus__) will not render a background image if set. 

## Formatting data point labels

Each data point has a textual presentation, called a data point label. This label can be formatted, positioned and rotated by various properties. 

Series labels default locations are:

* On bar series, labels are placed outside of the bars that represent data points.

* On line series, labels are placed above the line that represent data points.

###To change the position of data point labels in a Bar series:

1. Create a graph with bar series.

1. On the design surface, click on the bar series. The selected bar series properties are listed in the __Property Browser__. 

1. In the __Data Point Label__ section select a value for the DataPointLabelAlignment property. 

1. In the __Data Point Label__ section set a value for the DataPointLabelOffset property. The label offset direction depends on the DataPointLabelAlignment value. 

###To change the rotation angle of data point labels:

1. Create / select a graph.

1. On the design surface, click on the desired series. The selected series properties are listed in the __Property Browser__. 

1. In the __Data Point Label__ section set a value for the DataPointLabelAngle property. The value must be an integer in the 0 - 360 range and represents the rotation angle in degrees. Default value is 0. 

###To change the style of data point labels:

1. Create / select a graph.

1. On the design surface, click on the desired series. The selected series properties are listed in the __Property Browser__. 

1. In the __Data Point Label__ section select and edit the DataPointLabelStyle property. 

###To add conditional formatting to the data point labels:

1. Create / select a graph.

1. On the design surface, click on the desired series. The selected series properties are listed in the __Property Browser__. 

1. In the __Data Point Label__ section select and edit the DataPointLabelConditionalFormatting collection. 

## Formatting Series Colors

The Graph item comes with built-in palettes, and you can define additional custom palette. These palette colors also appear in the legend. When multiple series are added to the chart, the chart assigns the series a color in the order that the colors have been defined in the palette. 

If there are a greater number of series than there are colors in the palette, the chart will begin reusing colors, and two series may have the same color. To avoid confusion, define a custom palette with at least the same number of colors as you have series on your chart. 

You can select a palette or define a custom palette. Custom palettes are report-specific. 

###To change the series using a built-in color palette

> The built-in series are only available in the standalone report designer. 

1. Click the chart series that you want to change. The ribbon context tab __Graph Tools.Design__ is activated. 

1. In the __Chart Style__ group. Select a color palette from the __Change Colors__ dropdown. 

###To define custom color palette:

1. Click the chart series that you want to change. The selected axis properties are listed in the __Property Browser__. 

1. In the __Appearance__ group. Set the __ColorPalette property__ to - __Color Palette__. 

1. In the __Colors property__, click the __Edit Collection (â€¦) button__. The Color Collection Editor opens. 

1. Click __Add__ to add a color and select a color from the drop-down. 

1. Click __Add__ to add more colors to the palette. 

1. When you are done, click __OK__. 

If you are using a custom color palette, you can change the order of the colors to change the color of different series.

###To define custom __monochromatic palette__ :

1. Click the chart series that you want to change. The selected axis properties are listed in the __Property Browser__. 

1. In the __Appearance__ group. Set the ColorPalette property to - __Monochromatic Palette__. 

1. Set appropriately __BaseColor, MaxLightness and MinLightness properties__.

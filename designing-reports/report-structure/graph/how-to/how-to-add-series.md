# How to add Series

The Graph series can share existing category groups, series groups and coordinate systems or you can create those from scratch.

To add new series follow these steps:

1. Open __Series__ collection editor and __Add__ the desired series - Area, Bar or Line. 

1. Set the __CategoryGroup__ to an existing category group or create a new one from scratch. 

1. Set the __SeriesGroup__ to an existing series group or create a new one from scratch. 

1. Set the __CoordinateSystem__ to an existing coordinate system or create a new one. 

1. Set __X__, __Y__ or both to an expression, depending on which scale is numerical. 

1. For __range series__ set __X0__ or __Y0__ properties.

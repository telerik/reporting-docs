# How to add Series



The Graph series can share existing category groups, series groups and coordinate systems or you can create those from scratch.

## 

To add new series follow these steps:

1. Open __Series__  collection editor and __Add__  the desired series - Area, Bar or Line.             

1. Set the __CategoryGroup__  to an existing category group or create a new one from scratch.             

1. Set the __SeriesGroup__  to an existing series group or create a new one from scratch.             

1. Set the __CoordinateSystem__  to an existing coordinate system or create a new one.             

1. Set __X__ , __Y__  or both to an expression, depending on which scale is numerical.             

1. For __range series__  set __X0__  or __Y0__  properties.

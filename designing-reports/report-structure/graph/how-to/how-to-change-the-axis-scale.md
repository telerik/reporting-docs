# How to Change the Axis Scale

You can customize the scale to better meet your needs. When the values that are plotted in the chart cover a very large range, you can change the axis scale to a Logarithmic scale. In other cases you may need a DateTime scale. 

## How to change the axis scale to Logarithmic:

1. On the design surface, click on the axis. The selected axis properties are listed in the Property Browser. 

1. In the __Misc__ section for __Scale__ select the __Logarithmic Scale__ option. 

1. Set the __Groupings__ and __Series.X/X0/Y/Y0__ expressions to a __numeric__ field. 

## How to change the axis scale to Numerical:

1. On the design surface, click on the axis. The selected axis properties are listed in the Property Browser. 

1. In the __Misc__ section for __Scale__ select the __Numerical Scale__ option. 

1. Set the __Groupings__ and __Series.X/X0/Y/Y0__ expressions to a __numeric__ field. 

## How to change the axis scale to DateTime:

1. On the design surface, click on the axis. The selected axis properties are listed in the Property Browser. 

1. In the __Misc__ section for __Scale__ select the __DateTime Scale__ option. 

1. Set the __Groupings__ and __Series.X/X0/Y/Y0__ expressions to a __DateTime__ field. 

## How to change the axis scale to Category:

1. On the design surface, click on the axis. The selected axis properties are listed in the Property Browser. 

1. In the __Misc__ section for __Scale__ select the __Category Scale__ option. 

1. Remove the corresponding field from the series definition. If you have selected the X axis, remove the __Series.X/X0__ expression. If you have selected the Y axis, remove the __Series.Y/Y0__ expression. The entries (labels and tick marks for the category axis) are determined by the fields used in the CategoryGroups.Groupings expression. 

> The Scale settings are reset to __Category Scale__, when you use the Report Designer to change the Graph or specific Series Chart Type.

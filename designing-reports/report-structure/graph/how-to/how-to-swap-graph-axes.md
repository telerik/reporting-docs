# How to Swap Graph Axes

The graph series can be oriented towards both axes of its corresponding coordinate system.

###To change the orientation of all series inside of a graph:

1. Select the graph in the designer.

1. Right-click and select Swap Axes from the context menu.

> Performing this action will swap the X / Y values of all series and interchange the axes positions of all coordinate systems.

###To change the orientation of individual series:

1. Select desired series in the designer.

1. Right-click and select Swap Axes from the context menu.

> Performing this action will cause the selected series to swap their X / Y values. Additionally, the coordinate system referred by the series will also have its axes swapped. 
>
>If only some of the series sharing a coordinate system are rotated, a new coordinate system will be created and assigned to them. The new coordinate system will share it's axes with the original but with interchanged places (XAxis / YAxis, AngleAxis / RadiusAxis). Upon reversing the operation or changing the orientation of the rest of the series, sharing the former coordinate system, the two coordinate systems will be merged based on their axes.

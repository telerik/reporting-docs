# Formatting a Map Overview



It is important to understand the Map item key elements in order to setup and format it in a way that will improve the overall appearance.         The most common formatting options can be modified from the __Property Window__ when you click on the Map Item.       


Details about the Map item's elements can be found in the [Map Overview]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/map/structure/overview%}) help article.

# Parallels and Meridians



The parallels and meridians represent the coordinate system grid, called *graticule* .         You can format the graticule using the __Property Browser__ .       

##Graticule Step

Both parallels and meridians define a step that determines the density of their lines. By default the step value is __NaN__ , which           causes the graticule lines to be automatically adjusted depending on the current map extent.           The smaller the extent is, the smaller the graticule step becomes.         

###To change the Parallels or Meridians step:

1. Click the map item that you want to change.                 The selected map properties are listed in the __Property Browser__ .               

1. Expand the __Parallels/Meridians property__ .               

1. Select the __Step__  property and set it to the desired value.               

1. When you are done, press __Enter__ .               

##Graticule Style

You can change the parallels and meridians style by selecting the property and using the __Property Browser__  change Style properties.         

###To change the Parallels or Meridians style:

1. Click the map item that you want to change.                   The selected map properties are listed in the __Property Browser__ .                 

1. Expand the __Parallels/Meridians property__ .                 

1. In the __Style property__ , click the __Edit Collection (…) button__ .                     The Edit style dialog opens.                 

1. When you are done, click OK.

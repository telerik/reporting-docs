# How to Add Choropleth to Report



The simplest way to add a __Choropleth__  map to your report is to run the Choropleth Wizard.         After the Map item is added to the design surface, you can click its elements to edit the selected element's properties in the         *Properties*  grid. Additionally in the Standalone Report Designer you can use the Ribbon tools.

1. Open the Visual Studio toolbox and select Choropleth Wizard from the Telerik Reporting tab.

1. Follow the steps in the Choropleth Wizard.

1. When you finish the wizard a new Map item will be created on the design surface. The Map item is rendered with the real data               and its initial extent depends on the data you are using.

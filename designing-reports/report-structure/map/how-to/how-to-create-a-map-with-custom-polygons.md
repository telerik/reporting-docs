# How to Create a Map with custom polygons



This topic explains how to create a map that shows custom-defined shapes. The Map item processes and renders polygon primitives         using  [ShapeMapSeries](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.ShapeMapSeries) ,         which accept          [Well-known text/Well-known binary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text)          or          [ESRI Shapefile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile)          as a source. Since creating __ESRI Shapefiles__  requires additional tools, in this example the WKT polygon representation         will be used. The resulting report will display three American states whose coordinates will be obtained from a CSV data source.

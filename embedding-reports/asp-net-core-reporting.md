# Embedding Telerik Reporting in ASP.NET Core Reporting Applications

[ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core) is an advanced Web technology that lets you build modern cross-platform client-side, server-side and combined applications. This article offers a brief overview of the most popular approaches to integrate and use Telerik Reporting in ASP.NET Core Web Reporting applications.

## Supported Operating Systems and Docker Containers

The article [Available .NET Support for Operating Systems and Docker Containers]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/dot-net-core-support%}) elaborates on the specifics when deploying Telerik Reporting on different environments.

## Displaying Reports in ASP.NET Core Web Reporting Applications

The [HTML5 Report Viewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/overview%}) is an HTML/CSS/JS client-side widget suitable for any web application that works with JavaScript. This makes it the perfect widget for displaying Telerik Reporting Reports in all Web Reporting Applications.

### Requirements

.NET 6 introduced a [globalization-invariant mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/runtime-config/globalization) which, if enabled, does not allow the creation of any culture except the invariant culture. The Report Engine relies on instantiating cultures to support localization, formatting, and unit conversion, so enabling invariant globalization will break the engine's functionality. Refer to the [Only invariant culture is supported in globalization-invariant mode]({%slug only-invariant-culture-is-supported-in-globalization-invariant-mode-error%}) article for instructions on how to disable the `Invariant Globalization` mode.

### Implementation

The article [Using the HTML5 Report Viewer in an ASP.NET Core application in .NET]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/how-to-use-html5-report-viewer-in-an-asp.net-core-in-.net-5-application%}) is a step-by-step tutorial on embedding the HTML5 Report Viewer in ASP.NET Core Web Reporting projects.

## Generating Reports in ASP.NET Core Web Reporting Applications

The [Telerik Reporting REST Services]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/overview%}) provide an Application Programming Interface (API) over HTTP to the Reporting Engine that processes and renders [Telerik Reports]({%slug on-telerik-reporting%}#report-definition). The fully functional implementation of the service is available in the assembly/package `Telerik.Reporting.Services.AspNetCore`. It may be embedded in any ASP.NET Core Reporting Application and exposed in a custom controller (for example, `ReportsController`) inheriting the basic `ReportsControllerBase` class. The `ReportsController` may be used as a source of Report documents by Web Reporting, Desktop Reporting, and other third-party client applications.

### Implementation

There are different methods for configuring the Telerik Reporting REST Service in an ASP.NET Core Reporting project:

* [Hosting the Telerik Reporting REST Service in ASP.NET Core in .NET 6+ with __Minimal API__]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/asp.net-core-web-api-implementation/how-to-host-reports-service-in-asp.net-core-in-.net-6-with-minimal-api%})
* [Hosting the Telerik Reporting REST Service in ASP.NET Core in .NET 6 and .NET 8 with __Top-Level Statements__]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/asp.net-core-web-api-implementation/host-reports-service-in-.net-with-controllers%})
* [Hosting the Telerik Reporting REST Service in an ASP.NET Core Application in .NET 6, .NET 8 and .NET 9 with __Startup.cs__]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/asp.net-core-web-api-implementation/how-to-host-reports-service-in-asp.net-core-in-.net-5%})

## Designing Reports in ASP.NET Core Web Reporting Applications

The [Web Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/web-report-designer/overview%}) is an HTML/CSS/JS client-side widget that lets developers embed a report designer into their web reporting applications. It is ready for embedding in the ASP.NET Core Reporting Applications to allow the users to create, edit, and preview their Telerik Web Reports directly from the browser.

### Web Report Designer Requirements

The Web Report Designer requires a Report Designer REST service, whose fully functional implementation resides in the assembly/package `Telerik.WebReportDesigner.Services` as explained in the section [Web Report Designer Implementation](#web-report-designer-implementation).

### Web Report Designer Implementation

The tutorial [Setting up the Web Report Designer in .NET applications]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/web-report-designer/how-to-set-up-in-.net-5-and-.net-core-3.1-applications%}) elaborates on implementing the web designer widget and its REST Service in ASP.NET Core Web Reporting projects.

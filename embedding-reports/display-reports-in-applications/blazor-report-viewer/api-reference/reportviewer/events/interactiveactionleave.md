# The `InteractiveActionLeave` event of the Blazor Report Viewer

Gets or sets the viewer's interactiveActionLeave event handler function name. Occurs when the mouse cursor leaves the area of an interactive action.

## Event Binding

The report viewer currently exposes two ways for binding event handlers to events. You may attach event handlers when you instantiate the report viewer, or after that, using the [bind]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/blazor-report-viewer/api-reference/reportviewer/methods/bindasync%}) method.

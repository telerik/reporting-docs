# The `Ready` event of the Blazor Report Viewer

Gets or sets the viewer's ready event handler function name. Called when the viewer content has been loaded from the template and is ready to display reports or perform any other  operations on it. The function is executed in the context of the ReportViewer object that is available through the this object.

## Event Binding

The report viewer currently exposes two ways for binding event handlers to events. You may attach event handlers when you instantiate the report viewer, or after that, using the [bind]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/blazor-report-viewer/api-reference/reportviewer/methods/bindasync%}) method.

# The `SendEmailEnd` event of the Blazor Report Viewer

Gets or sets the viewer's sendEmailEnd event handler function name. Occurs after the report is exported and before the e-mail message is sent.

## Event Binding

The report viewer currently exposes two ways for binding event handlers to events. You may attach event handlers when you instantiate the report viewer, or after that, using the [bind]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/blazor-report-viewer/api-reference/reportviewer/methods/bindasync%}) method.

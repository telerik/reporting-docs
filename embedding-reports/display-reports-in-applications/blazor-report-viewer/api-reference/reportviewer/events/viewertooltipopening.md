# The `ViewerToolTipOpening` event of the Blazor Report Viewer

Gets or sets the viewer's viewerToolTipOpening event handler function name. The event occurs before a tooltip is opened, providing the ability to cancel its opening.

## Event Binding

The report viewer currently exposes two ways for binding event handlers to events. You may attach event handlers when you instantiate the report viewer, or after that, using the [bind]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/blazor-report-viewer/api-reference/reportviewer/methods/bindasync%}) method.

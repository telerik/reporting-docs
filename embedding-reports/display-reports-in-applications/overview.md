# Displaying Reports Overview

Telerik Reporting provides UI components called Report Viewers that you can use to display reports in applications. The Report Viewers cover various technologies (Angular, HTML5/JS, WPF, ASP.NET, Windows Forms, etc.) and allow you to display a report document in the application's UI and to interact with it.

This document provides a brief overview of the different [Telerik Report Viewer](https://www.telerik.com/products/reporting/delivering-viewing-exporting-reports.aspx) flavors. If you are interested in the Report Viewer for a specific technology, follow the corresponding link to learn more.

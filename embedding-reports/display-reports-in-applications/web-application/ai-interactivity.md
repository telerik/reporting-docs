# Overview of the AI Interactivity

Beginning with the **2025 Q2** release, we are introducing the new [AI-Powered Insights]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/adding-interactivity-to-reports/ai-powered-insights%}) functionality to our Web Report Viewers.

During the report preview phase, AI-generated insights offer an extensive suite of functionalities, including the formulation of responses, the construction of prompts, engagement with AI-generated content, and the execution of predefined instructions.

## Configuration

The [AI-Powered Insights]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/adding-interactivity-to-reports/ai-powered-insights%}) functionality can be enabled through the configuration file of the project where the [Reporting REST Service]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/overview%}) is running.

Below is an example of how to configure the project for the `AzureOpenAI` option.

````JSON

			"endpoint": "https://ai-explorations.openai.azure.com/",
			"credential": "...",
			"requireConsent": false,
			"allowCustomPrompts": false,
			"predefinedPrompts": [
				{ "text": "Can you summarise the report for me?" }
			]
		}
	}
}

## Visual Representation of the AI Prompt

The AI Prompt will change visually based on the configuration settings and the current selected state - *asking a question* or *inspecting the output*.

### Consent

Before any user can use this feature, upon opening the AI Prompt Dialog, they will be asked to give consent to the AI to process the provided text.

### Ask AI Prompt

After consent is given, the prompt for asking the AI questions will appear in the top-right corner of the report viewer. The UI will change depending on whether custom questions are allowed.

# Events Overview

## How to use the Events

1. Create a handler function in the component's `.TS` file:

	````TypeScript
export class ReportViewerComponent implements AfterViewInit {
		@ViewChild('viewer1') viewer: TelerikReportViewerComponent;
		...
		ready() {
			console.log('ready');
		}
		viewerToolTipOpening(e: any, args: any) {
			console.log('viewerToolTipOpening ' + args.toolTip.text);
		}
	}
````


1. In the `.HTML` component file, assing the handler to the corresponding event:

	````HTML
<tr-viewer #viewer1 [containerStyle]="viewerContainerStyle" [serviceUrl]="'http://localhost:59655/api/reports/'"
		[reportSource]="{
			report: 'Report1.trdp',
			parameters: {}
		}"
		[ready]="ready"
		[viewerToolTipOpening]="viewerToolTipOpening"
		[enableAccessibility]="false">
	</tr-viewer>
````

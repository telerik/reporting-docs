# Event Binding Overview

The Angular Report Viewer exposes these [Events]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/angular-report-viewer/api-reference/events%}) as input properties of the viewer component.

## Bind to a report viewer event

To attach an event handler to the viewer, specify the name of your function when binding the corresponding input property of the viewer component. For example, we can attach to the `ready` and `viewerToolTipOpening` events of the viewer:

````HTML
<tr-viewer
	...
	[ready]="myReadyHandler"
	[viewerToolTipOpening]="myViewerToolTipOpeningHandler">
</tr-viewer>
````

Then we create the event handler functions in the component where the viewer is used: 

````TypeScript
export class AppComponent {
	myReadyHandler() {
		console.log('The viewer is ready!');
	}
	myViewerToolTipOpeningHandler(e: any, args: any) {
		console.log('Tooltip shows: ' + args.toolTip.text);
	}
}
````

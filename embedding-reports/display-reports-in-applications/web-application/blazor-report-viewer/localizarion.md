# Localization of the Blazor HTML5 Report Viewer

The Blazor HTML5 Report Viewer is based on the [pure HTML5 Report Viewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/overview%}) and is using the same `Localization` mechanism - [Localization of the HTML5-based Report Viewers]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/customizing/localization%}).

# Methods and Commands Overview

The Blazor Report Viewer exposes methods and commands that allow you to control its behavior from application code.

## Get a report viewer reference to access the API

To call report viewer methods and execute commands, it is required to first get a reference to the report viewer object using the `@ref` attribute. Then use the __reportViewer1__ object to access the report viewer API. For example, a refresh and print of the current report can be triggered like this:

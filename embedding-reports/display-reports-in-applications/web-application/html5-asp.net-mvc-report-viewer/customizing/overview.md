# Customizing Overview

The HTML5 MVC Report Viewer is built with customization in mind. This means that the JavaScript client library provides the default viewer behavior and operations while the entire layout/markup is provided through HTML5 templates. The styling is based on CSS3 styles including the Kendo UI themes (again css styles).

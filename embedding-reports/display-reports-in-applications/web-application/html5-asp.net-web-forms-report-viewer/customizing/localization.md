# Localization of the HTML5 WebForms Report Viewer

The HTML5 WebForms Report Viewer is based on the [Html5 Report Viewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/overview%}) and is using the same [Localization]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/customizing/localization%}) mechanism.

# Customizing the HTML5 WebForms Report Viewer

The HTML5 WebForms Report Viewer is built with customization in mind. This means that the JavaScript client library provides the default viewer behavior and operations while the entire layout/markup is provided through HTML5 templates. The styling is based on CSS3 styles including the [Telerik Kendo UI SASS-Based Theme](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/styles-and-layout/sass-themes/overview).

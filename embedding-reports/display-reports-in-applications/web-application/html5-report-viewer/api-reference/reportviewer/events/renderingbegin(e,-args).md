## Event Binding

The report viewer currently exposes two ways for binding event handlers to events. You may attach event handlers when you instantiate the report viewer, or after that, using the bind method. For a complete list of binding options during initialization please check [Report Viewer Initialization]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/api-reference/report-viewer-initialization%}). For a complete list of all event names exposed through telerikReportViewer.Events please check [telerikReportViewer Namespace, Events]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/api-reference/telerikreportviewer-namespace/events%}).

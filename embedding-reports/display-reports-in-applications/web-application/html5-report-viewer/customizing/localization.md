# Localization

The article elaborates on how to localize the messages displayed by the HTML5 Report Viewer. This feature is available since version [R2 2018 SP1 (12.1.18.620)](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/reporting/release-history/progress-telerik-reporting-r2-2018-sp1-12-1-18-620).

1. To localize the report viewer messages, create a new JavaScript file with the required resources. You may use:

	* the resource file that gets deployed with the installation of the product in the subfolder `Html5\ReportViewer\js\telerikReportViewer.stringResources-{{site.buildversion}}.js`, for example: 
	
		`C:\Program Files (x86)\Progress\Telerik Reporting {{site.suiteversion}}\Html5\ReportViewer\js\telerikReportViewer.stringResources-{{site.buildversion}}.js`
	
	* the following code snippet:

		{{source=CodeSnippets\js\telerikReportViewer.stringResources}}


1. Specify the name of the file using the following convention: `resources.__[culture]__.js` where *[culture]* is the name of the culture for the specified localization resource. For example, to provide a localization resource for the French Belgian culture, the corresponding resource file could be named as follows: `resources.fr-BE.js`.

1. Add the newly created JavaScript file to the `head` element of the page between jQuery and telerikReportViewer.js files: 

	````HTML
<script src="resources.fr-BE.js"></script>
````


	>The localization file must be loaded on the page before viewer's script `telerikReportViewer.js` and after jQuery script.

1. Translate the texts for the specified culture

> To modify the HTML5 Viewer's HTML template that contains the toolbar, Preview, Parameters and DocumentMap areas, you will have to set the viewer's templateUrl.

# Integrating the Native Angular Report Viewer with the Reporting Service

This tutorial demonstrates how to add the native Angular Report Viewer component to a new Angular application.

## Prerequisites

The following list describes the prerequisites for completing the tutorial:

* Review the Angular Report Viewer [Requirements]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/native-angular-report-viewer/requirements%}).
* [Angular CLI Project](https://angular.io/cli).
* A running application that hosts a Reporting REST service at address `/api/reports`. For more information, see [Telerik Reporting REST Services]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/overview%}).

### Steps:

1. Create a new Angular application using the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli).
1. Install the Native Angular Report Viewer NPM package with the following command:

	````powershell
npm install @progress/telerik-angular-native-report-viewer
````

	>If you receive a *403 Forbidden Error*, you need to register and log in at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) before performing this step.
	>
	>````powershell
npm login --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org --scope=@progress
````


1. Once installed, import the `ReportingAngularViewerModule` in [your application root module](https://angular.io/guide/ngmodules#!#angular-modularity):

	````TypeScript
import { ReportingAngularViewerModule } from '@progress/telerik-angular-native-report-viewer';
	
	@NgModule({
		declarations: [
			AppComponent
		],
		imports: [
			BrowserModule,
			AppRoutingModule,
			BrowserAnimationsModule,
			ReportingAngularViewerModule
		],
		providers: [],
		bootstrap: [AppComponent]
	})
````


1. Use the report viewer selector - `reporting-angular-viewer` in the component's template:

	````HTML
<reporting-angular-viewer
		#report
		[reportSource]="{
			report: 'Report Catalog.trdx',
			parameters: {}
		}"
		serviceUrl="https://demos.telerik.com/reporting/api/reports"
		viewMode="interactive"
		[keepClientAlive]="true">
	</reporting-angular-viewer>
````


1. Install the Angular `localize` package - [Add the localize package](https://angular.io/guide/i18n-common-add-package#add-the-localize-package). This is required for the report viewer's localization functionality

	````powershell
ng add @angular/localize
````


1. Install one of the [Kendo UI for Angular themes](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/styling/), e.g. the [Default Theme](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/styling/theme-default/)

	````powershell
npm install --save @progress/kendo-theme-default
````


1. Reference the theme in the project using one of the supported approaches - [Compiling Themes from SCSS Source Files](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/styling/#toc-compiling-themes-from-scss-source-files). In this example, we will use the approach with the `angular.json` configuration which consists of adding the desired theme inside the `styles` array - [Angular workspace configuration: Styles and scripts configuration](https://angular.io/guide/workspace-config#styles-and-scripts-configuration):

	````JSON
"styles": [
		"src/styles.scss",
		"node_modules/@progress/kendo-theme-default/dist/default-ocean-blue.scss"
	],
````


1. Run the application `start` script:

	````powershell
npm run start
````

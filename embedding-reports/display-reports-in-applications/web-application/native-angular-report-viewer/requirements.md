# System Requirements

This article states the system requirements you need to work with the Native Angular Report Viwer.


## Operating Systems

The Native Angular Report Viwer is OS agnostic.


## Node.js

The required [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version is 14.0.0 or later. Alongside the Node.js installation, a supported [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) version will be installed.

To check your Node.js version, run `node --version` in a terminal or console window.

## Angular

The Native Angular Report Viewer is built with the [Kendo UI for Angular](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui) suite and as such, the Angular versions that it can be used on depend on the supported versions of said components - [Kendo UI for Angular Supported Versions](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/installation/requirements/#toc-angular)

## Kendo UI for Angular

The Native Angular Report Viewer is built using the [Kendo UI for Angular](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui) component library and thus using the viewer requires a license for said product - [Buy Kendo UI](https://www.telerik.com/purchase/kendo-ui).

The Native Angular Report Viewer is built with version [13.2.0 (2023-07-18)](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/changelogs/kendo-angular-ui/#v13.2.0) of [Kendo UI for Angular](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui) and will not support older versions.

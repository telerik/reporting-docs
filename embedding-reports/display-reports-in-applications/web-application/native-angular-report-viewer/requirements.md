# System Requirements

This article states the system requirements you need to work with the Native Angular Report Viewer.

## Operating Systems

The Native Angular Report Viewer is OS agnostic.

## Node.js

The required [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version is {{site.nodeversion}} or later. Alongside the Node.js installation, a supported [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) version will be installed.

To check your Node.js version, run `node --version` in a terminal or console window.

## Angular

The Native Angular Report Viewer is built with the [Kendo UI for Angular](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui) suite and as such, the Angular versions that it can be used on depend on the supported versions of said components - [Kendo UI for Angular Supported Versions](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/installation/requirements/#toc-angular).

The currently used version of [Kendo UI for Angular](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui) is v[{{site.angularsubsetversion}}](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/changelogs/kendo-angular-ui/#v{{site.angularsubsetversion}}) and it requires **Angular 15 or newer**.

## Kendo UI for Angular

The Native Angular Report Viewer is built using the [Kendo UI for Angular](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui) component library and thus using the viewer requires a license for said product - [Buy Kendo UI](https://www.telerik.com/purchase/kendo-ui).

The Native Angular Report Viewer is built with version [{{site.angularsubsetversion}}](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/changelogs/kendo-angular-ui/#v{{site.angularsubsetversion}}) of [Kendo UI for Angular](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui) and will not support older versions.

## Browser Support

<table style="width:100%">
	<tr>
		<th>Chrome</th>
		<th>Firefox</th>
		<th>Edge</th>
		<th>Safari</th>
		<th>iOS</th>
		<th>Android</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>

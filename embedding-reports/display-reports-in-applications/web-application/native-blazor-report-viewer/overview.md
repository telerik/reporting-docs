## Requirements

1. Required Application Version:

	+ Blazor 3.1+ application

1. Required Service:

	+ The viewer requires a running instance of [Telerik Reporting REST Services]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/overview%}) to display reports. It can be hosted either in the same Blazor application or the viewer can reference a service hosted in another origin. In the latter case make sure to [enable Cross-Origin Requests (CORS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cors?view=aspnetcore-3.1) in the REST Service project.

1. Required UI libraries:

	+ [Telerik UI for Blazor](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/introduction) {{site.blazoruiversion}} or later

1. Reference to one of the [Telerik UI for Blazor Built-in Themes](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/styling-and-themes/overview)

## Comparison with Blazor Html5 Wrapper Report Viewer

The current release of the Native Blazor Report Viewer component is missing only the `Accessibility` functionality which is present in its [`Blazor Wrapper Report Viewer`]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/blazor-report-viewer/overview%}) counterpart.

> The above functionality will be added in a future release of the Native Blazor Report Viewer.

## Demo

The complete example can be found in the installation folder of Telerik Reporting: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Progress\Telerik Reporting {{site.suiteversion}}\Examples\CSharp\CSharp.BlazorNativeExample.VS2022.sln`.

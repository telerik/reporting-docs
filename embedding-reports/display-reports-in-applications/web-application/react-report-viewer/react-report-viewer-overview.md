# React Report Viewer Overview

> The current React Report Viewer version is `{{site.spaviewerversion}}` and should be used with `Reporting REST Service {{site.buildversion}}` or `Telerik Report Server {{site.reportserverversion}}`.

You can integrate the React Report Viewer component in your React applications. Note that the viewer is introduced in [R1 2022]({%slug telerikreporting/upgrade/2022/r1-2022%}).

The React component is built on top of the [HTML5 Report Viewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/overview%}), which is the foundation for all Web-based report viewers as well.

## Requirements

To successfully integrate the React Report Viewer component, ensure the following:

1. Required React Application Version:

	+ [React 16.8.6+](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html) application

1. Required Service:

	+ The viewer requires a running instance of [Telerik Reporting REST Services]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/overview%}) in order to display reports. Make sure to [enable Cross-Origin Requests (CORS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/security/enabling-cross-origin-requests-in-web-api)  in the REST Service project.

1. The [React Report Viewer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@progress/telerik-react-report-viewer) requires the following peer dependencies:

	+ `react: ">=16.8.6"`
	+ `react-dom: ">=16.8.6"`
	+ `"jquery": "^1.10.0 || ^2.2.0 || ^3.7.0"`

1. Required references to Kendo UI styles:

	+ [Kendo UI Sass-Based Theme](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/styles-and-layout/sass-themes/overview)

## Browser Support

The React viewer is based on the [HTML5 Report Viewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/overview%}), thus the client browser should conform to the HTML5 Report Viewer [Browser Support]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/requirements-and-browser-support%}#browser-support).

# The `ToString` method of the HTML5 ASP.NET WebForms Report Viewer

Converts the HTML5 ReportViewer control to its HTML string representation with all configuration options and client-side initialization. Generates the final HTML output by populating viewer options and using ReportViewerWriter to create the complete HTML5 viewer structure with JavaScript initialization.

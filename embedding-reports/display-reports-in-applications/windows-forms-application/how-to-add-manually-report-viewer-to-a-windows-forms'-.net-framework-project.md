# How to Add manually report viewer to a Windows Forms' .NET Framework project

## Assign report to the viewer in design time

To use Telerik Reports in Windows Forms application, you need the Windows Forms report viewer:

1. Drag the __ReportViewer__ control from the __Toolbox__ to the form design surface.

1. Add reference to the class library that contains your reports in the windows form application.

1. Build the application.

1. Set the __ReportSource__ for the report viewer. For more information, see [How to Set ReportSource for Report Viewers]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/how-to-set-reportsource-for-report-viewers%}).

1. To run the report in the viewer, call __ReportViewer.RefreshReport()__ from your application code. 

## Assign report to the viewer programmatically

In the __Form_Load__ event handler you create an instance report source and set its __ReportDocument__ property to a report instance. Next assign the instance report source to the __ReportSource__ property of the viewer. Finally call __ReportViewer.RefreshReport()__.

{{source=CodeSnippets\VB\API\Telerik\ReportViewer\WinForms\Form1.vb region=Winviewer_SetReportSource}}

If the current application has to be declared as DPI-aware, an additional element needs to be added to the application manifest file, as explained in the article [Declaring the application as DPI-aware]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/windows-forms-application/overview%}#declaring-the-application-as-dpi-aware).

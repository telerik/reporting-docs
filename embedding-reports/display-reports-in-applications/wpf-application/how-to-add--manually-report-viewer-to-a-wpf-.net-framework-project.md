# Manually setting up the WPF Report Viewer in .NET Framework

This article explains the steps needed to manually create an application which uses the WPF report viewer.

## Add the WPF Report Viewer to the application

1. Create a new `WPF Application` project in Visual Studio. Target `.NET Framework 4.0 or higher`.

1. Add references to the following [Telerik UI for WPF](https://www.telerik.com/products/wpf/overview.aspx) `NoXaml` assemblies:

   - _Telerik.Windows.Controls.dll_
   - _Telerik.Windows.Controls.Input.dll_
   - _Telerik.Windows.Controls.Navigation.dll_
   - _Telerik.Windows.Data.dll_

   In case you are still not prepared to migrate to _Implicit Styling_, you can use the binaries that include the XAML. However, you will still have to merge all the XAML files mentioned in the next step, otherwise, the Report Viewer will not show up as it will have no styling.

   In case [Telerik UI for WPF](https://www.telerik.com/products/wpf/overview.aspx) is used only for the WPF Report Viewer, reference the _Telerik UI for WPF_ assemblies available with Telerik Reporting. They are internally unlocked for the WPF Report Viewer but can only be used with the report viewer. The `.NET Framework` assemblies containing _Telerik UI for WPF_ are located in `%programfiles(x86)%\Progress\Telerik Reporting {{site.suiteversion}}\Bin\WpfViewerDependencies\Framework`.

   The WPF ReportViewer is build with the latest official release of [Telerik UI for WPF](https://www.telerik.com/products/wpf/overview.aspx). In this way we provide a trouble-free upgrade for most of the users. This means that you can use the latest version of **Telerik UI for WPF** in your project and report viewer. It is possible that the Telerik UI for WPF assemblies have a greater version (service pack or internal build) than the one with which the WPF report viewer control targets. In this case, assembly binding redirects are required (see [Binding Redirects](#binding-redirects) topic below).

1. The Telerik UI for WPF XAML files are located in `%programfiles(x86)%\Progress\Reporting {{site.suiteversion}}\Wpf\Themes)`.

1. Drag and drop the **ReportViewer** control from the toolbox in a WPF window. If the ReportViewer is not available in the toolbox, you can add it using the instructions from the **How to add the WPF ReportViewer to the toolbox** topic below.

1. Add reference to the following `Telerik.Reporting` assemblies in your project:

   - _Telerik.Reporting.dll_
   - _Telerik.ReportViewer.Wpf.dll_
   - _Telerik.ReportViewer.Wpf.Themes.dll_

1. The next step is to merge these ResourceDictionaries in the App.xaml file:

   {{source=CodeSnippets\CS\API\Telerik\ReportViewer\Wpf\App.xaml}}

   For the above sample, we have used the **Fluent** theme. The WPF Report Viewer supports all the Telerik UI for WPF themes. In order to style the viewer with another theme, change the above XAML snippet **Fluent** with the desired theme name.

1. Set the `ReportSource` for the report viewer. For more information, see [How to Set ReportSource for Report Viewers]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/how-to-set-reportsource-for-report-viewers%}). This can be done either declaratively or programmatically:

   - Specifying a report source declaratively, we would use type report source for this example:

     {{source=CodeSnippets\CS\API\Telerik\ReportViewer\Wpf\Window1.xaml}}

   - Setting a report source at run time. The following code snippet illustrates how to assign a report source to the WPF ReportViewer in the [`Window.Loaded`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/advanced/how-to-handle-a-loaded-event?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8) event handler:

     {{source=CodeSnippets\CS\API\Telerik\ReportViewer\Wpf\Window3.xaml}}
     {{source=CodeSnippets\CS\API\Telerik\ReportViewer\Wpf\Window3.xaml.cs}}
     {{source=CodeSnippets\VB\API\Telerik\ReportViewer\Wpf\Window3.xaml}}
     {{source=CodeSnippets\VB\API\Telerik\ReportViewer\Wpf\Window3.xaml.vb}}

## Setting DataContext

Setting a `DataContext` to a parent element of ReportViewer leads to _BindingExpression path errors_, which can be safely **ignored**. This happens because ReportViewer, internally, uses a _view model_ and the `DataContext` gets propagated to the control before the view model is initialized. This leads to mismatch between the properties expected by ReportViewer and the ones in the DataContext.

At a later stage, the DataContext of ReportViewer's child elements is set to the expected view model (`ReportViewModel`), the bindings in the control get evaluated, therefore the errors get resolved. To avoid the binding errors you can set the `DataContext` of the parent element in the [`Loaded`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.frameworkelement.loaded?view=windowsdesktop-7.0) event handler of ReportViewer.

## Binding Redirects

In case you use _Telerik UI for WPF_ version greater than the **latest official release** (service pack or internal build), you have to redirect all assemblies required by the _Telerik WPF ReportViewer_ to their latest versions. To do this, add the following **bindingRedirects** to your `app.config` and replace the `2010.1.421.35` with the exact version of _Telerik UI for WPF_ assemblies:

{{source=CodeSnippets\CS\API\Telerik\ReportViewer\Wpf\WpfViewerBindings.xml}}

> [Redirecting Assembly Versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/redirect-assembly-versions) is a standard .NET technique for resolving assembly versions conflicts. `Visual Studio 2013` and newer, allows automatic binding redirects. For more details, please check [How to: Enable and Disable Automatic Binding Redirection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/how-to-enable-and-disable-automatic-binding-redirection).

## How to add the WPF ReportViewer to the toolbox

1. Select a WPF window file (e.g. `Window1.xaml`).
1. Open the toolbox and add your own tab or click on the General tab.
1. Right click in the selected tab area and select **Choose Itemsâ€¦** from the context menu.
1. The previous step will open **Choose Toolbox Items** dialog. Select the **WPF Components** tab and find the **ReportViewer** component from the **Telerik.ReportViewer.Wpf** assembly.
1. Click **OK**.

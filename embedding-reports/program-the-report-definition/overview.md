# Managing Reports Programmatically Overview

__Telerik Reporting__ offers a full API for programmatic control of reports. You can create, modify, and work with reports in code, just as you can from the Visual Studio IDE. In this section, you will see how to perform the following fundamental operations in code: 

* [Create Report Programmatically]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/program-the-report-definition/create-report-programmatically%})

* [Create Sections Programmatically]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/program-the-report-definition/create-sections-programmatically%})

* [Create Report Items Programmatically]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/program-the-report-definition/create-report-items-programmatically%})

* [Report Events]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/program-the-report-definition/report-events/overview%})

* [Serialize Report Definition in XML]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/program-the-report-definition/serialize-report-definition-in-xml%})

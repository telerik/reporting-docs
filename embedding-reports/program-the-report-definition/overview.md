* [Create Report Programmatically]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/program-the-report-definition/create-report-programmatically%})
* [Create Sections Programmatically]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/program-the-report-definition/create-sections-programmatically%})

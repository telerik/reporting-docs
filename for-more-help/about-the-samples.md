# About the Samples



Telerik Reporting Demos provide a set of pre-built samples         designed to demonstrate the breadth of the Telerik Reporting capabilities.       


The online examples are available at          [          http://demos.telerik.com/reporting/home.aspx        ](          http://demos.telerik.com/reporting/home.aspx        ).             Use the tree on the left to navigate between the sample reports. The live demos use the Web report viewers            and come with short video showing how they are created.       

You can also open the sample projects (C# or Visual Basic) in Visual Studio to see the full design and source            code for each of the sample reports. To open up the sample solutions go to the Start menu and select            __Progress |__  __Telerik Reporting {version} C#/VB.NET Examples Solution.__           The Visual Studio examples contain applications for all supported platforms. You may also find the demos in the             installation folder of the product. By default, this is             "C:\Program Files (x86)\Progress\Telerik Reporting {version}\Examples\CSharp/VB".             Most of the reports in the examples use the MS SQL Server               [AdventureWorks database](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms124659%28SQL.100%29.aspx).

# Creating the Table and Populating it with Data



This article is part of the Demo report guide on getting started with Telerik Reporting and demonstrates how to add an         [           SqlDataSource component         ]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-source-components/sqldatasource-component/overview%})         and present the fetched data into a table item.       

## Adding the SqlDatasource Component

This guide uses the __AdventureWorks__  database that is provided by Telerik Reporting.           The data sources that will be added to the report will generate their data representations.         

1. Select __Data__  > __SQL Data Source__  > __Existing data connections__  > __local:/Telerik.reporting.Examples.CSharp.Properties__ .

1. Click __Next__  > __Use as a shared connection__  > __Next__ .             

1. On the screen that loads, fill in the __Select Statement__  field with the following query.               The query will extract only the first 14 employees and they will be listed in ascending order according to their id, that is,               the employee with id=1 will be the first one, the employee with id=2 will come second, and so on.             

	
      ````sql

SELECT
[HumanResources].[vEmployee].[EmployeeID] ,
[HumanResources].[vEmployee].[FirstName],
[HumanResources].[vEmployee].[LastName],
[HumanResources].[vEmployee].[JobTitle],
[HumanResources].[vEmployee].[Phone]
FROM [HumanResources].[vEmployee]
WHERE [HumanResources].[vEmployee].[EmployeeID] <= 14
ORDER BY 1 ASC
````




1. From the grid with the properties, change the name of the data source to *tableDataSource*  so you can later refer it and render its data in the report.             

## Creating the Table

1. Click the __datailSection__ .             

1. From the bar, select __Insert__ .             

1. Select __Table__  > __Table Wizard__  > __tableDataSource__ .             

1. On the screen that loads, mark all columns and drag them to the __Table Columns__ . Click __Next__ .             

1. From the window that opens, select a predefined style for your table.             

1. Click __Next__  and __Finish__ .             

1. Apply the following __Styling__  to the table:             

   + __BackgroundColor__  and  __BorderColor__  set to be [34, 181, 115].                 

   + __Font > Name__  set to be __SegoeUI__ .                 

   + Mark the table header and set the __Color__  property to be __White__ .                 

1. Add the title of the table. To do that, add a TextBox and set its __Value__  to be "Employees".             

1. Insert two Shapes next to the text. Set the __ShapeType__  to be __Horizontal Line__  and make the __Color__  to be __Silver__ .              

## Previewing the Result

Preview the result by clicking __Preview__  > __PrintPreview__ .         

* The generated report uses the __Segoe UI__  font.             

* The color of its table title is __0, 105, 104__ .             

* [Shapes]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/shape%}) are used for the lines next to the table title.             

* The __BorderColor__  of the table is __34, 181, 115__ .

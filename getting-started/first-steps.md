# First Steps



Welcome to the Demo report guide on getting started with Telerik Reporting!       

This guide creates a use case scenario which demonstrates how to create, set up, and publish a         sample Demo report. In the report, we demonstrate how to create it, add datasource to it, visualize the data through a table and graph,         as well as how to style the report and its items. Finally, we will show how to display the report in .NET Application through the Html5 Report Viewer.       

Each major step, from installing the product and creating the         report to adding the column graph and integrating the report in the Visual Studio application,         is explained in a separate article as part of the complete guide.       

For more examples on Telerik Reporting, refer to         C:\Program Files (x86)\Progress\Telerik Reporting[VERSION]\Report Designer\Examples.

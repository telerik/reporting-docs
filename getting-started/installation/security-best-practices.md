# Security Best Practices

This article explains the recommended practices related to Security when working with Telerik Reporting.


## Configuration Settings

app configuration settings (assembly and types whitelisting, unsafe mode)


## Extending Telerik Reporting

Telerik Reporting lets you extend its built-in functionality with custom code, for example by introducing [Custom User Functions]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/extending-expressions/user-functions%}), [Custom Aggregate Functions]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/extending-expressions/user-aggregate-functions%}) and [ObjectDataSources]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-source-components/objectdatasource-component/overview%}). The Reporting Engine invokes the custom functionality with reflection. The allowed assemblies should be whitelisted in the configuration of the application hosting the Reporting Engine as explained in the article [assemblyReferences Element]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/export-and-configure/configure-the-report-engine/assemblyreferences-element%}). The entire responsibility for registering the custom assemblies and the security of their code is delegated to the developer.

>tip Use only trusted assemblies that are signed with a public key token (see [Assembly (CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_(CLI))) and cannot be replaced when extending the Reporting functionality in your projects, avoiding remote code execution and other malicious actions.

## Report Definitions

.trdx / .trdp definitions - guidance to ensure that report definitions come from trusted sources

type reports in .dlls - guidance to ensure that the .dll comes from trusted sources. For example, a bad agent may use remote code execution

rate-limiting in Reporting - responsibility of the client.

data connections must be with the least permissions.

data fetching can delete info from tables.

do not include connection strings and credentials in report files


## Reporting Services

The [Telerik Reporting REST Service]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/overview%}) is represented by the [abstract ReportsControllerBase class](/api/telerik.reporting.services.webapi.reportscontrollerbase). Its methods are not authorized. They are virtual and it is your responsibility to authorize the Reporting REST API defined in the custom ReportsController inheriting the ReportsControllerBase.

The requests for resources are marked with the [AllowAnonymous attribute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authorization.allowanonymousattribute?view=aspnetcore-8.0) by design. For that reason, the [Report Viewers]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/overview%}) won't add [authenticationToken]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/api-reference/reportviewer/methods/authenticationtoken(token)%}) to these requests. If you need to authenticate the whole Web API of the Reporting REST Service, you need to add the header with custom approach, for example, as explained in the following resources:

* [Request to '/api/reports/.../{documentId}' Is Not Authorized]({%slug why-get-document-request-is-unauthorized%})
* [Authorization in REST Service Controller]({%slug reporting-rest-service-authorization%})

# Video Onboarding for Telerik Reporting

Telerik Reporting has its own [video getting started course](https://learn.telerik.com/learn/course/external/view/elearning/38/telerik-reporting) available to both users with an active trial license and users with an active commercial license. The training course in Telerik's [Virtual Classroom](https://learn.telerik.com/learn) is developed to help you get started with the Telerik Reporting set of services and features. It aims to put you in the shoes of a report designer and an engineer who is integrating a reporting solution into an existing application.

In this course, you will use ASP.NET Core with Blazor and your job is to add a dynamic report page to a public tracking application that has already been developed. You will design and develop a report by using the Telerik Reporting Standalone Report designer. Then, you will incorporate that report into an existing app by using the Telerik Report Viewer for Blazor. You will also try different configuration options that come out of the box for Telerik Reporting, like communication between the report server and the web app, as well as hosting the report APIs in the app itself.

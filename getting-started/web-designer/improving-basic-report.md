# Implement a Common Master-Detail Report Scenario

In this step-by-step tutorial, we will improve the basic report created in the previous tutorial [Embedding the Web Report Designer in .NET 6 and Creating Your First Report]({%slug telerikreporting/getting-started/web-designer/set-up-and-create-basic-report%}) by adding a common business requirement to click a data series to show more details on a child report.

* First, you will create a second report to display the details data.
* Then, you will learn how to add [SharedDataSource component]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-source-components/shareddatasource-component%}) to share data sources between reports.
* Next, you will add and configure [PieChart]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/graph/chart-types/pie-charts/overview%}) to the detailed report.
* Finally, you will learn how to add a [Drillthrough/Navigate To Report Action]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/adding-interactivity-to-reports/actions/drillthrough-report-action%}) to the master report Column Chart.
* At the end you will have a master report able to navigate to a child report with detailed data for the selected Product Category.








The entire process is described in the YouTube video tutorial [Getting Started with the Web Report Designer: Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXKlgq-MYIU).

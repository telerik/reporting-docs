# Configure Web Report Designer and Create a Basic Report

This is a step-by-step tutorial that shows how to integrate the [Web Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/web-report-designer/overview%}) in `.NET 6` ASP.NET Core application in Visual Studio 2022.

* First, you will create a Web Application and add Telerik Web Report Designer through its Visual Studio Item Template.
* Next, you'll create and style a new report.
* Then, you will add a remote DataSource and connect it to a new Graph in the report.
* At the end you will have a web application with embedded Telerik Web Report Designer with the default `SampleReport.trdp` and the newly created `ProductSales.trdp` reports in its storage that you may preview and edit.

The entire process is described in the YouTube video tutorial [Getting Started with the Web Report Designer: Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-utkcB8-5c).

## Setting up the Web Report Designer in .NET 6

Lets create an ASP.NET Core application in Visual Studio and embed the Telerik Web Report Designer in it:

1. Open Visual Studio 2022 and create a new project through the project template `ASP.NET Core Web App`. Name the project, for example, `Telerik.WRD.GettingStarted` and select `.NET 6.0` as a Target Framework.
1. Add the Web Designer to the project:

	1. Right-click on the project and select `Add` > `New Item...`.

		![Open the menu for adding new item to your project through Visual Studio item template.](images/add-vs-item-template.png)

	1. You may search for `telerik reporting` to list the available Reporting item templates. Add `Telerik Web Report Designer HTML5 Page {{site.suiteversion}}`. The version may vary, depending on the last Reporting version installed.
	1. Name the new page `webReportDesigner.html` (this is the default name).

		![Searcing for and adding Web Report Desiger page 'webReportDesigner.html' through the Visual Studio item template.](images/add-web-report-designer-page.png)

	1. Build the project when prompted by Visual Studio.

1. Configure the Web Report Designer:

	1. In the popped-up _Add new .NET Core Web Report Designer_ wizard, select `Create new REST service` as we don't have an existing one.

		![Create new Web Report Desiger REST Service in the project through the wizard's 'Configure web report designer engine' page.](images/create-new-rest-service.png)

	1. On the next step the wizard will ask for the initial report to load. Select the `Sample report definition` option to create a new sample report if you don't have any.

		![Create sample report definition through the wizard's 'Configure report' page.](images/create-sample-report.png)

	1. When you click `Finish` you should see a status page confirming that everything was set up correctly.

1. (optional) Open the file `launchSetting.json` in the folder `Properties` and add the next line, setting the opening page to the "profiles" > "Telerik.WRD.GettingStarted" object. Note that the name of the project and the web page may vary:

	`"launchUrl": "webReportDesigner.html"`.

	![The 'launchSetting.json' file in project folder 'Properties' with added 'launchUrl'.](images/launch-setting-json.png)

1. Run the project. If everything is fine, you should see the web page with the designer with the sample report opened, and the onboarding guide to walk you through the main tools in the designer.

	We recommend getting familiar with the Web Report Desiger by clicking on the `Next` button in the guide. You may skip the guide at any step through the button `End Tour`. Pay attention to the Search functionality of the designer that lets you locate any report item, section, or property easily.

## Creating a New Report

Our next goal is to create a brand new report with the just configured Web Report Designer:

1. Go to the main toolbar `Menu` and select `New Report`. The `Create Report` dialog opens and lets you:

	1. Enter the `File Name`. Let's name the report `ProductSales`.
	1. Select the `Type`. Leave the `Type` to be `TRDP` standing for _Telerik Report Definition Packed_, the recommended Declarative [Report Definition]({%slug on-telerik-reporting%}#report-definition).
	1. Enter `Location`. Type `Demo` to place the report in the _Demo_ subfolder.
	1. Click `Save` to apply the settings.

	![The 'Create Report' dialog of the web designer with the above settings for our new report.](images/create-trdp-report-web-designer.png)

1. The new empty report should open in the designer with its default Page Header, Detail, and Page Footer sections. Let's delete the page sections by selecting them and pressing the `Delete` key from the keyboard.
1. Next, we want to add a [Report Header]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/how-to/how-to-add-remove-report-header---footer-sections%}). Press `Ctrl+F` to focus the Search box, type `Report Header`, and press `Enter` key to focus the report section in the `Components` menu. Click the item to add the section to the report.

	![Searching for the 'Report Header' and locating it in the web designer's 'Components' menu.](images/locate-report-header-component.png)

1. Let's add the company logo to the report.

	1. We need to add a [PictureBox]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/picturebox%}) to the Report Header. You may search for the report item, drag it to the Report Header and adjust its size and position as needed.
	1. To upload the logo, search for the `Value` property in the PictureBox, and click on the icon beside it. It opens the `Select File...` dialog, which represents the [Assets Manager]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/web-report-designer/tools/shared-resources%}#assets-manager). The latter contains report assets such as images, external stylesheets, etc.

		![The 'Select file...' dialog of the web designer opened when adding a value for the PictureBox.](images/select-image-for-picturebox-web-designer.png)

	1. Select the `Images` folder and click the `Upload` button to upload the image. Click on the `Browse` button to find the image on your system and open it. Add the selected image by clicking on the `Upload` button. Now the image is in the Assets Manager and you may click `Save`. The value should be populated and the image should be displayed in the PictureBox.

1. Add title to the report. You may use the [TextBox]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/textbox%}) report item.

	1. Search in the global search box of the designer and drag the item from the `Components` menu to the Report Header.
	1. You may change the text inline. Double-click on the item to enter it and type `Sales by Category`.
	1. Apply Styles by selecting the TextBox, searching for _Style_, and finding the appropriate _Font_ styles. Let's use the default Font "Arial", with Size 22pt, bolded, centered, and aligned to the middle.
	1. Position and realign the TextBox so that the content fits and looks beautiful.

	![The TextBox 'Sales by Category' styled and aligned in the web designer.](images/style-and-align-textbox-web-designer.png)

1. Our next step would be to add a [DataSource component]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-source-components/overview%}) to the Report. Let it be the [WebServiceDataSource]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-source-components/webservicedatasource-component/overview%}) fetching data from a remote source.

	1. Search for the component and add it to the report. It opens the _Configure Web Service DataSource_ wizard.
	1. For `ServiceUrl` we will add the known URL to our demo site `https://demos.telerik.com/reporting/api/data/ProductSales.min`. It points to a reliable JSON data file. Leave the other options with their default values.

		![The first page of the 'Configure WebServiceDataSource' wizard in the web designer.](images/configure-web-service-data-source-web-designer.png)

	1. Skip the next page, where you may add request parameters, as we don't have any.
	1. Skip also the third page that asks whether in design-time you would like to use real or mocked data. We will use real data (the default setting).
	1. Preview the data on the next page and click `Finish`.

		![The last page of the 'Configure WebServiceDataSource' wizard in the web designer showing the 'Preview data source results'.](images/preview-data-web-service-data-source-web-designer.png)

	1. The wizard closes and in the designer's `Explorer` tab you should see the new WebServiceDataSource component with its data fields listed.

1. Next, lets add the [Graph]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/graph/overview%}) item that is going to show the sales data.

	1. Search for `Column` and drag the Column chart from the `Explorer` menu to the report Detail section. This will open a chart configurator to the right pane.
	1. Select the WebServiceDataSource from the dropdown of the Graph DataSource property. The fields will be listed.

		![Configuring the Column Chart in the web report designer.](images/configure-column-chart-web-designer.png)

	1. Drag the `ProductCategory` field to the `Categories`.
	1. For the `Values` property use the `LineTotal` field.
	1. Click on `Create` to render the chart with real data and show it in the report.
	1. Finally, style the column graph:

		* Find and remove the `Legend` by unchecking its `Style` > `Visible` checkbox.
		* Enter the `Titles` section, select the graph title and uncheck the `Visible` checkbox in the `Style` section from the opened `Edit item` dialog.

		![Styling the Column Chart in the web report designer.](images/style-column-chart-web-designer.png)

1. Preview the pixel-perfect report document by clicking on the designers `Preview` button at the top right corner.

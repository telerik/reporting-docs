# Report Globalization Overview

Telerik Reporting offers the possibility to control the way numbers, dates, and currencies are displayed and to layout text in different directions.

A report is globalized with the help of a [System.Globalization.CultureInfo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.cultureinfo?view=net-7.0) object. You can specify a Culture for the entire [Telerik.Reporting.Report](/api/Telerik.Reporting.Report) by setting its [Telerik.Reporting.Report.Culture](/api/Telerik.Reporting.Report#Telerik_Reporting_Report_Culture) property. This will force all [Telerik.Reporting.TextBox](/api/Telerik.Reporting.TextBox) items to respect the assigned Culture. But you are not limited by one culture per report. You can mix an unlimited number of cultures, by setting the [Telerik.Reporting.TextItemBase.Culture](/api/Telerik.Reporting.TextItemBase#Telerik_Reporting_TextItemBase_Culture) property of a specific [Telerik.Reporting.TextBox](/api/Telerik.Reporting.TextBox). This will override the Report's Culture.

## Culture Inheritance

When determining what Culture to use for formatting strings and text direction, the rendering engine will inspect those objects in the following order:

1. The Culture of the __TextBox__.
1. If the TextBox has no Culture defined, the Culture of the __Report__ is used.
1. If the Report has no Culture defined, the Culture of the __CurrentThread__ is used.

>tip The Culture of the CurrentThread is determined by the Regional Settings of the machine the application is running on. (Control Panel->Regional Settings->Regional Options->Standards And Formats)

## Culture Dependant Properties

* __String Formatting__

Culture affects the way strings are formatted in Telerik Reporting. For example, if you set the British Culture (en-GB) for a TextBox and set it [Telerik.Reporting.Processing.TextItemBase.Format](/api/Telerik.Reporting.Processing.TextItemBase#Telerik_Reporting_Processing_TextItemBase_Format) to Currency ({0:C2}) you will see values like `Â£43.21`. The same applies to dates, times, and numbers.

* __Text Direction (LTR/RTL)__

Middle Eastern languages such as Hebrew and Arabic are generally written from right to left. If your TextBox will contain text written using an RTL script, then you simply need to specify the appropriate Culture, for example, "he" for Hebrew and "ar" for Arabic.

# Visual Studio Extensions

The **Visual Studio Extensions** for the **Telerik Reporting** product aim to help developers when creating applications with Telerik Reporting. They can be accessed through the *Extensions | Telerik | Reporting* menu.

The extensions handle the following major points in the development process:

A menu pops up that allows you to configure the REST Service properties:

Depending on the user's selection, the respective wizard is displayed, e.g. [Band Report Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/band-report-wizard/overview%}).

## Upgrade Wizard

The [Upgrade Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/upgrade-wizard%}) allows you to upgrade/downgrade a .NET Framework project to any installed Telerik Reporting version. It can be started by using the *Extensions > Telerik > Reporting > Upgrade Wizard* menu item:

![Start Upgrade Wizard](images/start-upgrade-wizard.png) 

After [installing Telerik Reporting]({%slug telerikreporting/installation%}) you can benefit the [Visual Studio Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/overview%}) in a .NET Framework project which facilitates the creation of new reports and importing reports from other formats in the Designer.

During the [installation process]({%slug telerikreporting/installation%}) of Telerik Reporting on your machine, the Telerik assemblies are added to Global Assemby Cache (GAC) as well. This enables the respective items in the Visual Studio Toolbox for a .NET Framework project as well:

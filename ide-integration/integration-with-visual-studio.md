# Integration with Visual Studio

The **Visual Studio Extensions** for **Telerik Reporting** aim to help developers when creating applications with Telerik Reporting.

The extensions handle the following major points in the development process:

* [Visual Studio Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/overview%}) - Creating new reports and importing reports from other formats in the Designer.

* [Upgrade Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/upgrade-wizard%}) - Upgrading Telerik Reporting to a newer version. The [Upgrade Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/upgrade-wizard%}) can be started by using the **Extensions > Telerik > Reporting > Upgrade Wizard** menu item:

    ![Start Upgrade Wizard](images/start-upgrade-wizard.png) 

* Toolbox configuration - During the [installation process]({%slug telerikreporting/installation%}) of Telerik Reporting on your machine, the Telerik assemblies were added to Global Assemby Cache (GAC). In case of any problems related to the Visual Studio Telerik Reporting Toolbox items, please refer to [Troubleshooting]({%slug telerik-reporting-toolbox-items-are-missing%}) article offering several tips.

# Visual Studio Code Integration

The [Telerik Reporting Productivity Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TelerikInc.telerik-reporting-productivity-tools) Extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) provides scaffolding for the Telerik Reporting native Angular viewer.

To create a new test app, you can use the Angular CLI:

`ng new ReportingAngularApp`

1\. In VS Code, in the Explorer, within your Angular application source folder, right-click where you want to add a reporting component and select **New Telerik Reporting Angular Project Item**:

2\. VS Code will prompt you that @progress/telerik-reporting-schematics is missing. To install it, click `npm i ...` in the prompt.

3\. The Telerik Reporting Angular Scaffolding wizard will open, showing the available Angular component options.

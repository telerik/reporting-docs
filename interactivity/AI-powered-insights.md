# AI-Powered Insights Overview

The AI-powered insights during report preview provide comprehensive capabilities, including response generation, prompt creation, AI output interaction, and execution of predefined commands.

>tip For a working example of this functionality, check the [AI Insights Report Demo](https://demos.telerik.com/reporting/ai-insights).

## Feature Concept

To bring the power of Generative AI (GenAI) into reporting workflows, we are introducing an **AI Prompt** that integrates seamlessly with our [HTML5-based Report Viewers]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/overview%}) and the [WPF Report Viewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/wpf-application/overview%}). This feature is designed to enhance productivity and user experience by enabling intelligent interactions with report content.

>note The **AI Prompt** functionality will be made available for the other [Report Viewers]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/overview%}) as well, in the releases to come. 

### Key Features:

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
  When enabled, the option helps produce more accurate, up-to-date, and relevant responses by referencing authoritative knowledge bases outside of the training data sources. By default, the feature is enabled.

  When enabled, you may configure the RAG through the [AIClient ragSettings element]({%slug telerikreporting/aiclient-element%}##attributes-and-elements).

  Alternatively, you may disable the feature by setting the _AIClient allowRAG_ attribute to _false_.
  
- **Predefined Summary Prompts**  
  Users can choose from a set of **predefined prompts** tailored for common tasks like summarization, explanation, and data insightsâ€”boosting efficiency with minimal effort.

- **Custom AI Prompts**
  Besides the predefined prompts, you can choose to allow custom prompts to be made by the end-users of the application.

- **End-User Consent for Data Sharing**  
  To ensure transparency and compliance, the **AI Prompt** will **request explicit consent** from users before sharing any data with GenAI services.

## User Consent for AI-Powered Insights

Before using the AI Prompt Dialog, users must give consent for the AI to process their provided text. This ensures transparency and user control over their data.

## Configuration

To enable the AI-powered insights functionality, you must provide a valid configuration that defines the AI client, model, and other essential details such as authentication credentials. This configuration also allows you to customize various aspects of the AI functionality, including user consent requirements, custom prompt permissions, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) settings. The AI configuration is managed through the [report engine configuration]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/export-and-configure/configure-the-report-engine/overview%}). For a complete list of available settings, check the table below. For an example configuration, refer to [Example Configuration](#example-configuration).

| Setting | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
|friendlyName|This setting specifies the name corresponding to the type of AI client you wish to use. For example, setting friendlyName to "MicrosoftExtensionsAzureOpenAI" indicates that the Azure OpenAI client is being utilized.|
|model|This setting specifies the AI model to be used for generating responses. For example, setting the model to "gpt-4o-mini" indicates that the GPT-4o mini model variant is being utilized.|
|endpoint|This setting specifies the URL of the AI service endpoint.|
|credential|This setting specifies the authentication credentials required to access the AI service. It ensures that the AI client can securely connect to the specified endpoint.|
|requireConsent|A boolean configuration option that determines whether users must explicitly consent to the use of AI models before the AI report insights features can be utilized within the application.|
|allowCustomPrompts|This setting is set to true by default. If you set it to `false`, users will only be able to use the predefined prompts and will not be allowed to ask custom prompts.|
|predefinedPrompts|This setting specifies a list of predefined prompts that the AI client can use. Each prompt is defined by a text attribute, which contains the prompt's content.|
|allowRAG|This setting specifies whether the [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) is allowed. The default value is _true_. Available only on projects targeting .NET and .NET Standard.|
|ragSettings|These settings specify the configuration of the [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) when allowed by the _allowRAG_ setting. Available only on projects targeting .NET8 or higher.|

__AI clients__

There are four available options for the `friendlyName` setting:

| Client Type | Friendly Name |
| ------ | ------ |
|Microsoft.Extensions.AI.AzureAIInference|"MicrosoftExtensionsAzureAIInference"|
|Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI + Azure.AI.OpenAI|"MicrosoftExtensionsAzureOpenAI"|
|Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Ollama|"MicrosoftExtensionsOllama"|
|Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI|"MicrosoftExtensionsOpenAI"|

Depending on which option will be used, a corresponding `Telerik.Reporting.Telerik.Reporting.AI.Microsoft.Extensions.{name}` NuGet package must be installed in the project. In other words, please install one of the following packages before continuing with the configuration:

- `Telerik.Reporting.AI.Microsoft.Extensions.AzureAIInference`
- `Telerik.Reporting.AI.Microsoft.Extensions.AzureOpenAI`
- `Telerik.Reporting.AI.Microsoft.Extensions.Ollama`
- `Telerik.Reporting.AI.Microsoft.Extensions.OpenAI`

### Example Configuration

Below is an example of how to configure the project for the `AzureOpenAI` option.

````JSON
{
	"telerikReporting": {
		"AIClient": {
			"friendlyName": "MicrosoftExtensionsAzureOpenAI",
			"model": "gpt-4o-mini",
			"endpoint": "https://ai-explorations.openai.azure.com/",
			"credential": "...",
			"requireConsent": false,
			"allowCustomPrompts": false,
			"allowRAG": true,
			"predefinedPrompts": [
				{ "text": "Prompt 1" },
				{ "text": "Prompt 2" }
			],

				"tokenizationEncoding": "Set Encoding Name Here",
				"modelMaxInputTokenLimit": 15000,
				"maxNumberOfEmbeddingsSent": 15,
				"maxTokenSizeOfSingleEmbedding": 0,
				"splitTables": true
			}
		}
	}
}
````
````XML
 <Telerik.Reporting>
     <AIClient
         friendlyName="MicrosoftExtensionsAzureOpenAI"
         model="gpt-4o-mini"
         endpoint="https://ai-explorations.openai.azure.com/"
         credential="..."
         requireConsent="false"
         allowCustomPrompts="false">
         <predefinedPrompts>
             <add text="Prompt 1" />
             <add text="Prompt 2" />
         </predefinedPrompts>
     </AIClient>
 </Telerik.Reporting>
````

## Extensibility

If necessary, the Reporting engine can use a custom `Telerik.Reporting.AI.IClient` implementation, which can be registered in the Reporting REST Service configuration:

````C#
builder.Services.TryAddSingleton<IReportServiceConfiguration>(sp => new ReportServiceConfiguration
{
    HostAppId = "MyApp",
    AIClientFactory = GetCustomAIClient,
    ...
});

static Telerik.Reporting.AI.IClient GetCustomAIClient()
{
    return new MyCustomAIClient(...);
}
````

 >note The configured predefined prompts can be modified at runtime by overriding the `UpdateAIPrompts` method of the [ReportsController](/api/telerik.reporting.services.webapi.reportscontrollerbase) class.

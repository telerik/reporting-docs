# Custom Actions Overview

A custom action is an action that contains a collection of parameters, defined by the user, that will be evaluated during report processing. It does not affect the currently viewed report in any way - its purpose is to be used in a report viewer's interactive action event handlers: `InteractiveActionExecuting()`, `InteractiveActionEnter()`, and `InteractiveActionLeave()`. 

To define a [CustomAction](/api/Telerik.Reporting.CustomAction) use the [Edit Action Dialog]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/edit-action-dialog%}) or create it programmatically in the report class body. 

Here is an example of how to get the custom action's parameters in the [`InteractiveActionExecuting`](/api/telerik.reportviewer.winforms.reportviewerbase#Telerik_ReportViewer_WinForms_ReportViewerBase_InteractiveActionExecuting) event of the __WinForms Report Viewer__.

# How to Add a Custom Action

## Adding a custom action using the Report Designer

1. In the Design view, right-click the report item to which you want to add a link and then click __Properties__. 
1. In The Properties dialog box for that report item, click __Action__. The [Edit Action dialog]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/edit-action-dialog%}) will open. 
1. Select __Custom__. An additional section appears in the dialog box, containing a button titled __Select parameters__. 
1. Clicking the button will open the __Edit Custom Action Parameters__ dialog box. Add one or more parameters, defining their *Name*  and *Value*  properties. 
1. Click __OK__ when ready. 
1. To test the action, preview the report and click the report item with the applied custom action. A message will appear, displaying information for the action's properties.

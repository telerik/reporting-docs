# Welcome to Telerik Reporting

Progress® Telerik® Reporting is a .NET/.NET Framework [embedded reporting tool](https://www.telerik.com/products/reporting/embedded-reporting.aspx) that enables you to create, design, export, and integrate reports in cloud-based, web, and desktop applications.

Telerik Reporting provides web and desktop report designers and services, and report viewer controls. The desktop components and the services are .NET/.NET Framework-only, whereas the HTML5-based components can be integrated into virtually any website or application.

With Telerik Reporting you can retrieve and process data from relational, multi-dimensional, ORM, or custom data-layer-based data sources.

End users can view the ready reports in PDF, Microsoft Office Word, Excel, and PowerPoint document formats, or use a dedicated viewer in a Web or .NET/.NET Framework desktop application.

## Key Components

The lifecycle of a Telerik report is divided into three main steps&mdash;designing the report, populating the report with data and rendering it in a viewer, and exporting the report to a document file.

The Telerik Report Designers and Viewers are the main components of Telerik Reporting and accompany the users in their journey along the lifecycle of the report.

### Report Designers

The Report Designers are responsible for the designing process.

* Report Designers are tools that help you create the report you require, connect it to a data source to load the information you need, style its header, footer, and general appearance, make report collections if necessary, and export its content to PDF, for example.
* Which Report Designer you choose depends on the specific functionality you want to use.

|Report Designer|Specifics
|:---|:---
|Standalone desktop designer|<ul><li>A single `.exe` file representing a Windows tool powered by the Telerik Reporting engine.</li><li>Uses the latest UI standards to facilitate the process of creating reports, locally analyzing report data, exporting and sharing.</li></ul>
|Web report designer|<ul><li>An HTML-, CSS-, JavaScript-and-jQuery-based widget allowing you to integrate a report designer into your web applications.</li><li>Styling is based on the Kendo UI Sass Default theme.</li><li>Previews reports in the HTML5 Report Viewer.</li></ul>
|Designer for Visual Studio|<ul><li>Dedicated to editing CLR or type report definitions (CS or VB files) in the Visual Studio environment.</li><li>Available under the .NET Framework only.</li></ul>

### Report Viewers

The Report Viewers are UI components that are tailored to a specific technology.

* Report Viewers are tools that enable you to deploy and render your report in applications that are built on various technologies such as ASP.NET Core or Angular.
* Which Report Viewer you will choose to use depends on the targeted technology of the application.

# Welcome to Telerik Reporting

Progress® Telerik® Reporting is a .NET embedded reporting tool which enables you to create, design, export, and integrate reports in cloud-based, web, and desktop applications. 

Telerik Reporting provides .NET report designers, report viewer controls, and services. The tool supports ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET WebForms, Angular, React, and Blazor as well as WinForms, WPF, and WinUI. 

Telerik Reporting can retrieve and process data from relational, multi-dimensional, ORM, or custom data-layer-based data sources. The end users can view the ready reports in PDF, Microsoft Office Word, Excel, and PowerPoint document formats, or use a dedicated viewer in a Web or .NET desktop application. 

## Key Components 

The main components of Telerik Reporting are its designers and viewers. 

### Report Designers 

The Reporting designers are responsible for the designing process. They are tools which help you create the report you require, connect it to a data source to load the information you need, style its header, footer, and general appearance, make reports collections if necessary, and export its content to PDF, for example. Which designer you will choose depends on the specific functionality you want to use in the process.

The Telerik Reporting designer tools are: 

|Telerik Reporting Designer|Specifics
|:---|:---
|Standalone desktop designer|<ul><li>A single `.exe` file representing a Windows tool powered by the Telerik Reporting engine.</li><li>Uses the latest UI standards to facilitate the process of creating reports, locally analyzing report data, exporting and sharing.</li></ul>
|Web report designer|<ul><li>An HTML5-, JavaScript-, or CSS3 jQuery-based widget allowing you to integrate a report designer into your web applications.</li><li>Styling is based on the Kendo UI Sass Default theme.</li><li>Previews reports in the HTML5 Report Viewer.</li></ul>
|Designer for Visual Studio|<ul><li>Dedicated to editing CLR or type report definitions (CS or VB files) in the Visual Studio environment.</li><li>Available under the .NET framework only.</li></ul>

### Report Viewers

The Reporting viewers are UI components which are tailored to a specific technology. Viewers are tools which enable you to deploy and render your report in applications that are built on various technologies such as ASP.NET Core or Angular. Which viewer you will choose to use depends on the targeted technology of the application that will host your report.

The Telerik Reporting viewer tools are: 

|Telerik Reporting Viewer|App Type|Essentials

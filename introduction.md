## Introduction

Reports communicate information, make decisions, and identify opportunities. Telerik Reporting is a reporting solution for all.NET cloud, web, and desktop platforms that provides a full range of ready-to-use tools and services to help people in your organization to quickly and easily create, deploy, and use reports.

Telerik Reporting can retrieve and process data from relational, multidimensional, ORM or custom data layer based data sources. The ready reports can be viewed in various formats (including PDF, Microsoft Office Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents), and can be viewed with a dedicated viewer in a Web or.NET Desktop application. 

While you can create rich interactive and reusable reports in [Visual Studio Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/overview%}), end users are able to create reports in the desktop-based [Standalone Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/overview%}).

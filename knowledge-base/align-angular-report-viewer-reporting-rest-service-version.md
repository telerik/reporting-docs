## Description

When using the Report Viewer in an ASPNetZero-based project, an error stating that the version of the Report Viewer does not match the version of the Reporting REST Service _'[object Object]'_ may appear. This issue arises because ASPNetZero, which is based on BoilerPlate, wraps every API response, altering the expected result format for the Report Viewer.

This knowledge-base article also answers the following questions:
* How to fix the Report Viewer version mismatch error in ASPNetZero projects?
* How to prevent BoilerPlate from wrapping API responses?
* What is the correct way to configure the ReportsController in ASPNetZero for Telerik Reporting?

## Solution

To resolve the version mismatch error between the Report Viewer and the Reporting REST Service in ASPNetZero projects, apply the `[DontWrapResult]` attribute to the `ReportsController` on the server-side REST API. This approach prevents BoilerPlate from modifying the result structure, allowing the Report Viewer component to receive the response in the expected format.

1. Locate the `ReportsController` in your ASPNetZero project.
1. Apply the `[DontWrapResult]` attribute to either the entire controller or the specific action that returns the version information.
1. Rebuild and rerun your application.

By applying the `[DontWrapResult]` attribute, the REST API will return the version information as a plain string (e.g., "18.3.24.1218") instead of a wrapped object, matching the expected format by the Report Viewer.

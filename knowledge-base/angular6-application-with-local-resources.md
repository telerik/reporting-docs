## Description
After upgrading to Angular 6, it should be considered that there are a few differences about the project setup. For example, the **angular-cli.json** is replaced with **angular.json** file. Also the local stylesheet which by default are CDN links, must be loaded as local files only in **assets** folder as this seems to be required for this version.
For more information, please check the [Unable to load the css file in angular 6 application](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50666689/unable-to-load-the-css-file-in-angular-6-application) article.

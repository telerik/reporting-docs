## Description

On attempt to connect WPF or WinForms ReportViewer to an engine of remote type, i.e. [Report Server](https://docs.telerik.com/report-server/introduction) or [REST Service]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/overview%}), the following error occurs:

`The assembly Telerik.Reporting.Services.HttpClient.dll cannot be loaded.`

## Solution

The `Telerik.Reporting.Services.HttpClient.dll` is required if the selected engine is of remote type (REST Service or Report Server). Please make sure that you have added a reference to this assembly to the current project.

It could be found in Telerik Reporting installation directory. For example `C:\Program Files (x86)\Progress\Telerik Reporting {{site.suiteversion}}\Bin\Telerik.Reporting.Services.HttpClient.dll`.

As a side note, we strongly suggest using the [Telerik Report Viewer Window Item Template]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/wpf-application/how-to-add-report-viewer-to-a-wpf-.net-framework-project%}) to create a window and host the report viewer in it. It will automatically add all required references and verify if all resources needed are added to the project.

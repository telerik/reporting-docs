## Description

Cannot create an object of type `Telerik.Reporting.Report` from its string representation `MyNameSpace.MyClass, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null` for the `Report` property.

## Cause

This error might occur if you are using website and you have the report class in the website directly.

## Solution  

The issue is due to the fact that when using a website, after rebuild, the following will always be different and it will not match with the originally assigned report: `App_Code.__unch8s_n__`. It is recommended that you follow the [best practices](66CD7D60-7708-42D5-8BB4-506676E8679E) and have the report in a separate class library that is referenced in the application or website.

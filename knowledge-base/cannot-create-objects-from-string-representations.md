## Description

`Cannot create an object of type "Telerik.Reporting.Report" from its string representation "MyNameSpace.MyClass, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null" for the "Report" property.`

## Cause

This error might occur if you are using a WebSite project and you have the report class in the WebSite directly.

## Solution

The issue is due to the fact that when using a WebSite, after rebuild, the following will always be different and it will not match with the originally assigned report: `App_Code.__unch8s_n__`. It is recommended that you follow the [best practices]({%slug on-telerik-reporting%}) and have the report in a separate class library that is referenced in the application or WebSite.

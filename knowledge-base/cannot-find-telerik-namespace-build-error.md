## Description

A `The type or namespace name 'Telerik' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)` error occurs on build.

## Cause

The possible reason for this issue is that Telerik assemblies are not properly referenced or updated.

## Solution  

Double-check if the project has references to Telerik Reporting assemblies and if `CopyLocal` is set to `true` in the Visual Studio Property grid. If you have recently updated your Telerik Reporting installation, run the [Upgrade Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/upgrade-wizard%}) in all related projects in Visual Studio.         

If Telerik Reporting assemblies are referenced and updated, verify that the project targets.NET4+ framework Full Profile version.

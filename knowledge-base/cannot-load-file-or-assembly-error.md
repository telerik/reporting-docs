## Description

When deploying a project with Telerik Reporting on a server, I get the `Could not load file or assembly 'Telerik.ReportViewer.WebForms, Version=x.x.x.x, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=a9d7983dfcc261be` (or one of its dependencies) error.

## Cause

The system cannot find the specified file. During the installation of Telerik Reporting on a developer machine, the Telerik Reporting assemblies are added to GAC. When deploying a project by using the Visual Studio built-in functionality, the assemblies from the GAC are not automatically copied.

## Solution  

You need to make sure that the assemblies physically exist in the `bin` folder of your application. For the full details, refer to the [Deploying Web Applications]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/asp.net-web-forms-report-viewer/deploying-web-applications%}) article.

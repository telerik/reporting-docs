## Description

An `Error loading the report viewer's templates. (Template = /api/reports/resources/templates/telerikReportViewerTemplate-html)` occurs when using the HTML5 Telerik Reporting ReportViewer.

## Cause

The error message indicates that the [Reporting REST service]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/overview%}) is not responding.

## Solution  

To solve the issue, use the following approaches:

* Check the HTML5 Viewer [`serviceUrl`]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/api-reference/report-viewer-initialization%}) and adjust the relative path.

* Try [adding `~` or removing the first `.`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178116.aspx).

* It is recommended to test the service by address in the browser as described in the article on [adding the Telerik Reporting REST web API to web applications]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/asp.net-web-api-implementation/how-to-add-telerik-reporting-rest-web-api-to-web-application%}).

* The issue might be related to duplicating routes of the WebAPI controllers. To avoid such a possibility, [change the Telerik Reporting REST Web API routes registered byu default](http://www.telerik.com/support/kb/reporting/details/how-to-change-reporting-rest-web-api-routes-registered-by-default).

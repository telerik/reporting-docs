## Description

>The described scenario and suggested solution relate to the legacy ASP.NET WebForms ReportViewer. It is recommended that you migrate to the [HTML5 ReportViewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-asp.net-web-forms-report-viewer/overview%}).

I am unable to serialize the session state when working with Telerik Reporting.

## Cause

In the `StateServer` and `SQLServer` modes, ASP.NET will serialize the session state objects, and as a result non-serializable objects or `MarshalByRef` objects are not permitted. The same restriction applies if similar serialization is done by the custom session state store in the `Custom` mode.

## Solution  

This exception might occur if you try to use objects which do not implement `ISerializable` for a Report or Data Item data source. For example, if this is an `IList`, you can try using a `List` instead as shown in the [cars Reporting demo](http://demos.telerik.com/reporting/list-bound-report).

You can also use the `NeedDataSource` event of the report and assign the data source to the "processing report", thus avoiding any need for serialization or deserialization.

Another approach is to use a `DataSet` or `DataTable`:         


````C#
DataTable dt = new DataTable();
DataColumn col = new DataColumn("ColumnName", typeof(string));
//....
dt.Columns.Add(col);
foreach (object Item in MyIList)
{
    DataRow row = dt.NewRow();
    row["ColumnName"] = Item;
    //.....
    dt.Rows.Add(row);
}
````

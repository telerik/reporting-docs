## Description

Learn how to change the sort direction dynamically of a group within a report based on the value of a parameter. The group should be sorted either in descending order or ascending order. 

## Solution

To dynamically control the sort direction of a group based on a parameter, follow these steps:

1. Define a report parameter with the appropriate value type, for example, `SortByDirection`. This parameter will be used in the expression for sorting the data to achieve interactivity. The **AvailableValues** are: 'ASC' and 'DESC'.

1. In the report designer, navigate to the report properties. Then, the SortByDirections parameter can be used for the report's **Sortings** collection:

	The idea is to introduce two Sorting rules, with 'ASC' and 'DESC' order, and apply sorting by only one of them, with the corresponding order.

	For example, when the user selects _ASC_ for the _SortByDirections_ parameter, we apply proper Sorting Expression for the corresponding _ASC_ rule. In this case, the Sorting Expression for the _DESC_ rule returns _Null_ (or other constant), guaranteeing no change in the data order caused by it. This way, the sorting is done in ascending order.

1. Apply the changes and preview the report. The sorting direction of the specified group will change based on the value of the `SortByDirection` parameter.

For more information on sorting data in reports and using report parameters, refer to the following Telerik Documentation articles:

- [Ordering Data]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-items/ordering-data/overview%})
- [How to Add Report Parameters]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/report-parameters/how-to-add-report-parameters%})

## Notes

- Interactive sorting, allowing users to toggle between ascending and descending order (without any parameter), can also be achieved using sorting actions. For more details, see [Sorting Action Overview]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/adding-interactivity-to-reports/actions/sorting-action/overview%}).

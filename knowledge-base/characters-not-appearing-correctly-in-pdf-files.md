## Description  
Strange symbols and squares appearing at the place of text in a PDF produced by Telerik Reporting. Possible causes are:
- The used font is not TrueType;
- The used font does not support the characters you need to display;
- The used font is not available on the server and/or the client machines.

  
## Solution
The Telerik Reporting rendering mechanisms use native objects for the selected media.
  
 In order to produce a PDF that visualizes content correctly via Telerik Reporting, the report must be designed with **TrueType font** that is available on the machine where reports are processed and rendered. Reports are processed and rendered server-side.  
  
 If the text contains special characters like **custom glyphs, icons**, you need to check if the font supports them. You may need to switch to a font with **Unicode characters support** e.g. Arial Unicode MS.  
  
 If the **font cannot be installed on the server machine**, where reports are processed and rendered, you can use <a href="../configuring-telerik-reproting-privatefonts" target="_blank">**Telerik Reporting privateFonts settings**</a>. The settings are applicable only through the configuration file of the application. You will need to <a href="../configuring-telerik-reporting" target="_blank">declare a Telerik.Reporting section first</a>.  
  
 If the **font is not available on the client machine**, you can fully embed the fonts in the PDF file during its generation. You will need toÂ <a href="../configuring-telerik-reporting" target="_blank">declare a Telerik.Reporting section first</a>. Then you need to configure the PDF extension and its <a href="../device-information-settings-pdf" target="_blank">**FontEmbedding**</a> parameter:  


```html
<Telerik.Reporting>
   <extensions>
     <render>
       <extension name="PDF" >
         <parameters>
           <parameter name="FontEmbedding" value="Full"/>
         </parameters>
       </extension>
     </render>
   </extensions>
</Telerik.Reporting>
```

```	json
"telerikReporting": {
  "extensions": [
    {
      "name": "PDF",
      "description":  "PDF Description",
      "parameters": [
        {
          "Name": "FontEmbedding",
          "Value": "Full"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
  
 The settings can be done in code if you export programmatically - <a href="../configuring-telerik-reporting-extensions#set-rendering-parameters-programmatically" target="_blank">Set rendering parameters programmatically</a>.

## Description

An `Error Client with ID 'xxxxxx-xxxx' not found. Expired.` occurs when using the HTML5 Telerik Reporting ReportViewer.

## Cause

The error message indicates that the ID of the Report Viewer cannot be found in the cache storage.

## Solution  

To solve this issue, use the following approaches:

* Check if the [time set as the `ClientSessionTimeout` of the Reporting REST service has expired]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/export-and-configure/cache-management/html5-report-viewer-and-reporting-rest-services%}).

* Alternatively, fix the [`Storage` of the Reporting REST service]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/rest-service-report-source-resolver/overview%}), if it is not set according to the hosting environment.

## Description

This tutorial shows how to convert types inheriting the base class [Telerik.Reporting.Report](/api/telerik.reporting.report) created with the Visual Studio Report Designer to `.trdp` format for various reasons, such as ease of use or distribution. This KB article also answers the following questions:
- How can I manage .cs reports in the Standalone Report Designer?
- Is it possible to convert code-based reports to the TRDP format?
- What steps should I follow to transition from .cs report files to .trdp in Telerik Reporting?

## Solution

Let's start with a Class library project that contains the reports:

The project targets .NET Framework 4.6.2 or higher:

>note For projects targeting .NET, use the Standalone Report Designer for .NET.

To convert a `.cs` report to a `.trdp` report, use the [Standalone Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/overview%}). This tool allows for importing `.dll` files produced from projects containing types inheriting `Telerik.Reporting.Report`, facilitating the conversion process.

### Steps for Conversion

1. **Compile the Project**: Ensure your project containing the `.cs` report files is compiled successfully, generating a `.dll` file that includes the Report types.
1. Copy the produced dll (e.g. ProductCatalogLibrary.dll) and paste it next to the `exe` of the appropriate report designer considering the Target framework of the project:

1. **Open Standalone Report Designer**: Launch the Telerik [Standalone Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/overview%}).
1. **Add an Assembly Reference** to the Standalone Report Designer: [Extending Report Designer to Recognize Custom Assemblies]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/configuration/extending-report-designer%}).

1. **Import the DLL**: From the Report Designer, select to import reports, and navigate to the `.dll` file produced by your project from the first step above. The Standalone Report Designer will launch the [Import Report Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/import-report-wizard%}) and will list all reports available in the `.dll` for import. Follow the wizard:

	![Select Reports to Convert](images/select-reports-to-convert.png)

	![Output Settings](images/output-settings.png)

	![Import Summary](images/import-summary.png)

1. **Save as TRDP**: After successfully importing the `.cs` reports, save them in the `.trdp` format using the Standalone Report Designer's save functionality.

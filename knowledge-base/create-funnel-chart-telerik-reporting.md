## Description

I would like to create a funnel chart in Telerik Reporting. How can I achieve this?

## Solution

To create a bar chart that resembles a funnel chart [add two bar series]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/graph/how-to/how-to-add-series%}) that share a category group and have opposite values.

For example, if the value field is called "Value", the X-axis expression can be `= Sum(Fields.Value) / 2.0` for one of the series and `= - Sum(Fields.Value) / 2.0` for the other.

This will force the two series to display on both sides of the Y-axis and center the bars in the graph's surface area.

## Demo
You can find a [Sample Funnel Chart Report](https://github.com/telerik/reporting-samples/blob/master/Sample%20Reports/Funnel%20Chart.trdx) that illustrates the above in our GitHub Reporting-Samples repository.

## Notes

Please note that this workaround provides a similar visual effect to a funnel chart. If Telerik Reporting implements a funnel chart type in the future, you may consider using that for a more streamlined approach.

## Description
I need to provide custom headers with every API call made by the Angular Report Viewer. My goal is to add an authorization token.  
I add the custom header via the interceptor (*token-http-interceptor.service.ts*). However, the header is not added to the calls made by the Angular Report Viewer.

## Solution
The Angular Report Viewer is a wrapper of the HTML5 Report Viewer, which is a jQuery widget and not a native Angular component. 
That's why you cannot add custom headers the Angular way - via the HTTP interceptor. In this article, we suggest two possible solutions.

### Solution 1
The Angular Report Viewer comes with out-of-the-box support for an [*authenticationToken* option](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/angular-report-viewer-api-options). 
This option adds an *Authorization* header for every request to the REST service.

### Solution 2
The second solution is to add the custom headers to the REST API calls of the Angular Report Viewer with *jQuery's* [ajaxSetup](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajaxsetup/) function: 

The following code represents one possible approach that can be used in the component with the Angular report viewer:

````JavaScript
  ngOnInit(): void {
    let $: any = (window as any)["jQuery"];
    $.ajaxSetup({xhrFields: { withCredentials: true } });
  }
````

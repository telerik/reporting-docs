## Description

An `Access to the path 'xxxxxx\value.dat' is denied.` error occurs when using the HTML5 Telerik Reporting ReportViewer.

## Cause

The error message indicates that the Reporting REST service cannot access the configured file storage.

## Solution  

To solve this issue, use the following approaches:

* Verify the Reporting REST service has an unique [`HostAppId`](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.Services.ReportServiceConfiguration#Telerik_Reporting_Services_ReportServiceConfiguration_HostAppId) in its configuration.

* Make sure that the application has read-and-write access to the folder [specified by the `FileStorage` instance]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/rest-service-storage/overview%}) in the Reporting REST service configuration.

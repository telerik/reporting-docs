## Description

- Telerik Reporting 2024 Q1 (18.0.24.130) and older.

## Root Cause

In Progress® Telerik® Reporting versions prior to 2024 Q1 (18.0.24.130), a code execution attack is possible through an insecure deserialization vulnerability. In the case of CVE-2024-1856, this may also be possible to leverage remotely in a special set of circumstances in a misconfigured web application.

## Solution

Updating to at least version Reporting [2024 Q1 (18.0.24.305)](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/reporting/release-history/progress-telerik-reporting-2024-q1-(18-0-24-305)) is the only way to remove this vulnerability. Please visit the upgrade documentation [Upgrade Overview - Telerik Reporting]({%slug telerikreporting/upgrade/overview%}) and follow the instructions for the version you are upgrading from.

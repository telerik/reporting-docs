## Description

I need to prevent users from creating new database connections in the Web Report Designer's SqlDataSource component while still allowing them to select from pre-configured existing connections.

## Solution

To stop users from creating new SQL database connections, use a middleware to intercept the `/api/reportdesigner/connectionspermissions` request and modify the response. By returning an empty JSON or an object with all values set to `false`, you can disable the "Build new data connections" option.

````C#
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    if (context.Request.Path.Equals("/api/reportdesigner/connectionspermissions"))
    {
        context.Response.ContentType = "application/json";
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("{}"); // Return empty JSON to disable "Build new connections".
        return;
    }

    await next();
});
````

## Description
Print a report directly at client-side without displaying it in the web page.

## Solution
The general approach is explained and demonstrated in the [Print a report directly at client-side without displaying it in a Viewer](https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/reporting/details/print-a-report-directly-at-client-side-without-displaying-it-in-a-viewer).

To avoid displaying the PDF report on the page, instead of creating a response that will update the current page, use an invisible _iframe_ attached run time, where to open the generated PDF. The PDF document should be saved in a folder accessible by the application, so that the _src_ attribute of the _iframe_ can point to the file.

## Description
With the [Telerik® Reporting R3 2019](../release-history/progress-telerik-reporting-r3-2019-13-2-19-918) we have introduced
our new Telerik Web Report Designer, which is HTML5/JavaScript/CSS3 jQuery-based widget that allows developers to integrate a report designer
into their web applications. 
```

Note that the [Telerik Web Report Designer](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/web-report-designer#prerequisites) does not support theming. 
The Web Designer is built to use a customize version of Kendo SASS Default theme. The Designer loads all styles that are required by itself.
There is no additional option that could prevent it.
```

## Solution
In this article we are going to integrate the jQuery-based Telerik Web Report Designer in angular application
```

## Steps
1. Add reference to all required [Telerik Web Report Designer resources](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/web-report-designer#prerequisites)
in the main html page of the application. For the purpose of this 
example, this should be index.html.
``` HTML
<head>
   ...
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/2020.1.114/js/kendo.all.min.js"></script>
    
    <script src="https://demos.telerik.com/reporting/api/reports/resources/js/telerikReportViewer"></script>
    <script src="https://demos.telerik.com/reporting/api/reportdesigner/designerresources/js/webReportDesigner"></script>
  </head>
```
2. Declare jQuery in the component were the Telerik Web Report Designer will be initialized
``` TypeScript
declare var $: any;
```
3. Initialize the Telerik Web Report Designer after Angular has fully initialized the component.
``` TypeScript
ngAfterViewInit(): void {
    this.designer = $("#webReportDesigner").telerik_WebReportDesigner({
        serviceUrl: "https://demos.telerik.com/reporting/api/reportdesigner/",
        report: "Product Catalog.trdp"
    }).data("telerik_WebDesigner");
}
```

## Desciption  

Telerik products, including Telerik Reporting, can be used via Nuget packages. To access Nuget packages you need Telerik account allowing you to connect to the private Telerik Nuget feed - <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blogs/we-maintain-a-telerik-nuget-feed" target="_blank">We Maintain a Telerik NuGet Feed</a>.  
  

The connection to the private Nuget feed requires user and password, which are not stored automatically.  
  
## Solution  

This is an issue with .NET Core tooling and its options for storing passwords for private feeds - <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/3174" target="_blank">Restore fails when a NuGet feed with Encrypted Credentials (default) is defined on the system</a>. The comment in the first post elaborates how to store the username and password in plain text to allow the restore operation.

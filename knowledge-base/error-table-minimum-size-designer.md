## Description

Trying to set a width or height sizing of less than 10px on table/crosstab/list row or column results in the *Each table row and column maintains a minimum size, resulting in a minimum table size of {Width=10px, Height=10px}* error. Usually, such error occurs when user try to make a row or column not visible by basically reducing its width or height(or both) to zero. The correct way to hide a row or a column is through [Conditional Formatting](../styling-conditional-formatting) or a [Binding](../expressions-bindings) to the **Visible** property.

## Error Message

*Each table row and column maintains a minimum size, resulting in a minimum table size of {Width=10px, Height=10px}*

## Possible Causes 
  
- The report contains a [Table/Cross/List item]({% slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/table-crosstab-list/overview %}) with Width or/and Height properties  set to 0.   
 Setting Table/CrossTab/List item's size properties to zero values in Report Designers was possible in versions prior to [R3 2016 SP1](../release-history/telerik-reporting-r3-2016-sp1-(version-10-2-16-1025)). Upgrading the report from earlier version to **R3 2016 SP1** will result in the mentioned error in the design view if the report contained Table/Cross/List item with **zero** width or/and height.  
  
- Table/Cross/List item was created programmatically and its width or/and height was set to 0.

- The code for generating Table/Cross/List item in the **Report.Designer.cs(vb)** file was modified and zero values were inserted manually for item's width(height).  
  
- Table/CrossTab item is nested inside another table's cell using Table/CrossTab Wizard. This is a known issue, a workaround is to first create two tables separately and then nest one table inside another table's cell.
  
## Solution 
  
Removing the problematic item from the report's definition or setting non-zero values for item's Width(Height) properties  will resolve the issue:  
  
1. Downgrade the report to the previous version using [Upgrade Wizard](../ui-upgrade-wizard) which will allow opening the *Design view*. After that, locate the item using the [Report Explorer](../ui-report-explorer) and delete it or set non-zero values for Width(Height) properties (**recommended**).  
  
2. Open report's **.Designer.cs(vb)** file, locate the code for setting item's [Size property](../p-telerik-reporting-reportitem-size) and set Width and Height to values greater than 0.  
  
## Notes

Setting Table/Cross/List item's Width(Height) properties to 0 should be avoided. If the requirement is to hide the item, you can use item's **Visible** property instead. Setting the *Visible* property to **False** will hide the item in the rendered report.

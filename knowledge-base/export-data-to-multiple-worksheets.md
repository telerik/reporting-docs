## Description

Telerik Reporting Excel rendering extension exports a report into a single worksheet in the Excel workbook. How to export report content to multiple worksheets.

## Solution

To export the data into multiple worksheets, add several reports to a [ReportBook]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-book/overview%}).
Each report in a ReportBook will occupy a separate worksheet in the Excel workbook.

ReportBook can be created programmatically or using [Standalone report designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/overview%}).

ReportBook support for Standalone designer was added in the R1 2017 release. To start creating ReportBook, select **File | New** from the designer menu and choose a ReportBook report template.

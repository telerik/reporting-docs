## Environment

<table>

			<td>Product</td>
			<td>Progress® Telerik® Reporting</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Report Viewer</td>
			<td>Native Blazor</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


## Description

Clicking on the `Export` button from the menu of the [Native Blazor Report Viewer]({%slug telerikreporting/embedding-reports/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/native-blazor-report-viewer/overview%}) when hosted in the Telerik UI for Blazor [TelerikWindow](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/window/overview) modal window component doesn't display the expected available export formats. The problem is in the [ContextMenu](https://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/components/contextmenu/overview) that is opened when clicking on the `Export` button. It is hidden behind the modal window.

This is a known bug in the Telerik UI for Blazor - [The ContextMenu is hidden behind the Modal Window #2554](https://github.com/telerik/blazor/issues/2554). Solving this issue should fix the problem also in the viewer.

## Suggested Workarounds

Increase the Z-index of the Telerik UI for Blazor ContextMenu that lists the available export options, so that it is displayed on top of the TelerikWindow modal window. Here is a sample code you may add to the page with the viewer to fix the problem:

````HTML
<style>
	.k-animation-container {
		z-index: 15000;
	}
</style>
````

## Description

A `The expression contains undefined function call MyUserFunction()` error message occurs.

## Cause

The possible causes for the error message to occur are the following:

* The function name is typed in manually in the expression, without building the class library, and it does not exist yet.

* The function is used with an incorrect number or type of parameters. The passed fields must match the function signature.

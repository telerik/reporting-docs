## Environment

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Product</td>
			<td>Progress® Telerik® Reporting</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

## Description

Imagine the following scenario.

We want to group a report, and in each group to show a table that is filtered to show only records with a specific field value, for example, set as a [Report Parameter]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/report-parameters/overview%}) value. We also want the table to be with a different layout depending on the number of records it will display. Here are the more specific requirements for clarity:

We want to show all groups and a different table in each group:

* Case 1 - only for those with specific `Fields.Type` and more than 3 records to show.
* Case 2 - only for those with specific `Fields.Type` and 2 records to show.
* Case 3 - only for those with specific `Fields.Type` and 1 record to show.

Filtering by the value of the `Fields.Type` is possible, however, it is not possible to filter on the count of the filtered items or another [aggregate function]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/expressions-reference/functions/aggregate-functions%}). The latter leads to the error message in the report stating that `DataItem Filtering expression should not contain aggregate functions.`

Aggregates may be used on the group filtering level, however, this will take into account the entire report data and not only the data shown in the group.

## Solution

Let's use a [SubReport]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/subreport%}) in the [Report Group Header or Footer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/how-to/how-to-add-remove-report-header---footer-sections%}) instead of a Table. We will bind its DataSource to its parent DataSource, which is the group data. The idea is to apply the filtering by the value of `Fields.Type` in the subreport and pass different DataSources with [Bindings]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/bindings%}) to different Tables that are going to represent each case.

We simulate the filtering with an aggregate function with a Binding for the inner [Data Items']({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-items/overview%}) DataSources.

Here are the sample steps for implementation:

1. Add a `SubReport` item in the Report Group Header and use Bindings to set its DataSource to `ReportItem.DataObject`. 
1. Create a new report definition and use it as a ReportSource of the main report SubReport. 
1. Add a new `Filter` to the subreport with [Filtering Rule]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-items/filtering-data/filter-rules%}) to display only particular Types. 
1. Set the subreport Report Header/Footer `CanShrink` to `True` to allow the section to shrink when some of its items are hidden. 
1. Add 3 (three) tables in the subreport Report Header/Footer - one for each case. For each table configure the following properties: 

	* Set `NoDataMessage` to a valid string or whitespace. This is needed in order for the `NoDataStyle` to be applied.
	* Set `NoDataStyle` > `Visible` to `False`. 
	* Bind the `DataSource` of each table to the corresponding Expression: 

		1. Case 1 `= If(CountDistinct(Fields.Name) >= 3, ReportItem.DataObject, Null)` 
		1. Case 2 `= If(CountDistinct(Fields.Name) = 2, ReportItem.DataObject, Null)` 
		1. Case 3 `= If(CountDistinct(Fields.Name) = 1, ReportItem.DataObject, Null)` 

	* Configure and Style each table as required. 

With the above settings, for any number of names (i.e. _Fields.Name_) in the corresponding type (i.e. _Fields.Type_) only one table will have data and will be shown, simulating filtering based on an aggregate of its inner data.

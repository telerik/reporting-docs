## Description

While adding the native ReportViewer to a Blazor WebAssembly project, the "Create new REST service" option is unavailable. This happens because Blazor WebAssembly operates strictly as a client-side application, running directly on the browser UI thread. As a result, the Reports Web Service cannot be hosted within the same project.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, host the Reporting REST Service in a separate project. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new ASP.NET Core project for the Reports Web Service.
1. Implement the Reporting REST Service in the new project using Minimal API. Refer to the article [Hosting the Reporting REST Service in ASP.NET Core with Minimal API]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/asp.net-core-web-api-implementation/how-to-host-reports-service-in-asp.net-core-in-.net-6-with-minimal-api%}).
1. Integrate the separately hosted Reporting REST Service with your Blazor WebAssembly project.

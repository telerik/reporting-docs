## Description

In this article, we will explain why a font may be missing in the Report Designers and how to possibly fix that.

## Solution
   
- Is the missing font **OpenType**?
 
The Telerik Reporting engine uses the **GDI+** library and depends on the fonts that **GDI+** supports. 

In this line of thoughts, .NET supports **only** TrueType fonts. Thus, you can not use **OpenType** fonts with Telerik Reporting. If applicable. you can convert the OpenType font to **TrueType** using a [free online converter](http://www.freefontconverter.com/).   
   
> If the font is TrueType, check if the font is installed in **%windir%\fonts** .

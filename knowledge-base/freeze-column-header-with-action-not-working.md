## Environment
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Product</td>
			<td>Progress® Telerik® Reporting</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Report Viewer</td>
			<td>HTML5</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


## Description

When you [Freeze Column Headers]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/adding-interactivity-to-reports/table-header-freezing%}) of a Table/Crosstab and apply an [Action]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/adding-interactivity-to-reports/actions/overview%}) to a Table Header Cell, the headers don't freeze in the web viewers.

## Suggested Workarounds

Add the TextBox with the Action in a [Panel]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/panel%}) rather than directly in the Table/Crosstab cell. This sets the action on an item that is not directly in the Table/Crossttab and allows the header to freeze as expected in the Html5 Report Viewer and its wrappers.

## Description

How can I share existing category groups, series groups, and coordinate systems or create these from scratch when working with the Graph?

## Solution

To add new series to the Graph:

1. Open the __Series__ collection editor and __Add__ the desired series, for example, Area, Bar, or Line. 

1. Set __CategoryGroup__ to an existing category group or create a new one. 

1. Set __SeriesGroup__ to an existing series group or create a new one. 

1. Set __CoordinateSystem__ to an existing coordinate system or create a new one. 

1. Set __X__, __Y__, or both to an expression, depending on which scale is numerical. 

1. For __range series__, set the __X0__ or __Y0__ properties.

## Description

How can I change the chart type when working with the Graph?

## Solution 

It is important to select the correct [chart type]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/graph/chart-types/overview%}) for your data so that it can be interpreted correctly. 

When you display multiple series on a graph, you may want to change the chart type of an individual series. You can only change the chart type of an individual series if the chart type is Area, Column, Line, or Scatter. For all other chart types, all series in your chart will be changed to the selected chart type. 

To change the chart type:

1. In the **Design** view, right-click the graph or graph series. The graph context menu opens.

1. Click the __Change Chart Type__ option.

1. In the __Change Chart Type__ dialog box, select a chart type from the list.

1. When you are done, click **OK**.

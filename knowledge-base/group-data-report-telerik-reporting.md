## Description

Creating a report with grouped data according to a specific column, including conditional formatting and total calculations, is required. This knowledge-base article also answers the following questions:

* How to use a single DataSource to group data in a Telerik Report?
* How to add a Crosstab with row grouping by a specific criterion in a Telerik Report?
* How to apply conditional formatting for alternating rows in a Telerik Report?

## Solution

To achieve a report with data grouped by a specific column, including conditional formatting for alternating groups and total calculations, follow these steps:

1. Add a [List]({%slug table_template_items%}) item to the Detail section of the report and set its _DataSource_ to the _DataSource_ containing the fields to group by.
1. Add a new parent row group to the _List_, setting the expression of the group to the field(s) you wish to group by. Ensure the _"Add Header"_ option is checked.

1. In the _List_ header section, make it visible through the _"Style.Visible"_ property. This section will display the grouped content.
1. Insert a [Panel]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/panel%}) item in the header section of the _List_.
1. Add a [TextBox]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/textbox%}) item to the _Panel_ and set its value to the field(s) the _List_ is grouped by.
1. Add a [Table]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/table-crosstab-list/overview%}) item to the _Panel_ (below the TextBox) and set its _DataSource_ to the DataObject of the _List_ through a [Binding]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/bindings%}).

1. For [conditional formatting]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/styling-reports/conditional-formatting%}), select the _Panel_ item and apply a background colour alternation between groups using the [expression]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/overview%}) `= RowNumber('name-of-the-list-item') % 2`.

1. To add totals, use a Crosstab item with row grouping by the criterion (e.g., Gender) and add a Total outside the gender groups to display the Sum of both genders.
1. Apply _conditional formatting_ to the Crosstab for alternating district backgrounds using the same modulo operation as in step 7.

This approach eliminates the need for multiple _DataSource_ calls and allows for efficient grouping, total calculations, and conditional formatting within a single report.

## Description

I need page numbering based on a specific group using Standalone Designer. Instead of absolute page numbers, I want the numbering to reset within each group. For example, if there are two pages per group, the numbering should appear as "Page 1 of 2" and "Page 2 of 2" for the first group, then reset to "Page 1 of 2" for the next group. This numbering should reflect the pages within the group scope.

## Solution

To implement group-specific page numbering, follow these steps:

### Using Built-in Page Functions
1. Open the report in the Standalone Designer.
1. Define a group for the desired field (e.g., `ResidentID`) at the report level if not already done.
1. Add a TextBox to the page footer.
1. Use the following expression to display page numbering within the group:

   ```
   ="Page " + PageNumber("residentGroup", Fields.ResidentID) + " of " + PageCount("residentGroup", Fields.ResidentID)
   ```
   
   - Replace `"residentGroup"` with your group's name.
   - Replace `Fields.ResidentID` with the key field of the group.
 
1. Assign the data source directly to the report to ensure the group scope functions correctly.

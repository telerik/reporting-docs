## Description

Telerik Reporting Expression engine allows you to reuse the data of a parent scope. This includes binding a subreport to the main report's data.

This article provides the required steps for binding the SubReport to the Main Report's Data.

## Solution

- Open the report that will be used as a subreport in the designer and use the following [binding to the report's DataSource property](../expressions-bindings): 

````
Property path: DataSource
Expression: =ReportItem.DataObject
````

 When the subreport is loaded by a SubReport item in the main report, the sub report will get the data associated with the SubReport item.

- You can change the scope to a greater parent by using the [Parent keyword](../p-telerik-reporting-reportitembase-parent). For example:

````
Property path: DataSource
Expression: =ReportItem.Parent.Parent.DataObject
````

## Notes

In case you need to display data in a tabular format, another approach for organizing the main report's layout can be found in [How to Databind to Collection Properties]({%slug how-to-databind-to-collection-properties%}).

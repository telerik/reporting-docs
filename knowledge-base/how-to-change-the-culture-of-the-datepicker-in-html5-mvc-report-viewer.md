## Environment

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Product</td>
			<td>Progress® Telerik® Reporting</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


## Description

The datepicker is a [Kendo widget](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/controls/editors/datepicker/overview).
That is why the Html5 MVC Report Viewer localization will not affect its date representation.

This KB article gives a brief description of how to set up another language. The example will demonstrate the date representation in **Spanish**.

## Solution

1. Add the following script after the script for the report viewer:

	````HTML
<script src="http://kendo.cdn.telerik.com/{{kendosubsetversion}}/js/cultures/kendo.culture.es-PY.min.js"></script>
```` 

2. Then, the culture of the Kendo widget must be set through the script below which should be placed before the report viewer's initialization:

	````HTML
<script type="text/javascript">
		kendo.culture("es-PY");
	</script>
````


 ## Demo

## Description
The error below is thrown when tring to connect to MySQL Database through the SQL DataSource Wizard in the Web Report Desginer.

## Error Message
Connection unsuccessfull.Check the connection string and try again. Keyword not supported:'port'.

## Cause\Possible Cause(s)
The problem is caused by an issue in the SQL DataSource Wizard that doesn't provide the correct Data Provider name. 
In the wizard on the first page, the **Data Provider** must be **MySql.Data.MySqlClient**, but the option is limited only to MySql.Data. 
Since the engine cannot determine the type of the data provider by that name, it falls back to **System.Data.SqlClient** and claims that "Port" is not a supported keyword.

## Suggested Workarounds
The workaround is to avoid using the SQL DataSource wizard and edit the data source properties directly in the properties grid. 
The issue is logged in our [Feedback portal](https://feedback.telerik.com/reporting/1535638-connecting-to-mysql-from-the-sql-datasource-wizard-does-not-work-in-webreportdesginer), so you can vote for it and when it is fixed, you will get a notification.

## Description
Out of the box, the [drilldown](./designing-reports-interactivity-how-to-add-drilldown-action) (toggle visibility action) icon is with a fixed position. 
This article explains how to control it by using a panel and a textbox.


## Solution
In order to change the icon's position, our suggestion is in the place of the [Textbox](./report-items-text-box) toggle item to insert a [Panel](./report-items-panel). 
Then add within the panel item another panel for toggle visibility action (drilldown) and a textbox for the cell text (the previously used textbox). 
This way you can control the drilldown icon's exact position within the main panel item.

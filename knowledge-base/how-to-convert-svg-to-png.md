## Description
Currently, the [PictureBox](../report-items-picture-box) can hold only the formats supported by GDI+ (BMP, GIF, JPEG, EXIF, PNG, and TIFF). This KB article demonstrates how to convert SVG graphics to PNG picture and to set it as a value of the picturebox. Note that a NuGet package called [Svg](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Svg/) should be added to the project. The approach is approperiate for reports which are designed in the Standalone Designer, as well as in the Visual Studio Report Designer.

## Solution
 1. A [UserFunction](../expressions-user-functions) should be implemented through the code snippet below
	
```CSharp
public static Bitmap ConvertToBitmap(string url)
{
	var svgDocument = Svg.SvgDocument.Open(url);
	svgDocument.ShapeRendering = SvgShapeRendering.Auto;

	Bitmap bmp = svgDocument.Draw(120, 120); // Draw Bitmap in any Size you need - for example 120px x 120px
	return bmp;
}
```
 2. Register the user function as explained in [Extending Report Designer article](../standalone-report-designer-extending-configuration). A reference to the Svg.dll should be also attached.

3. Then the value of the picture box should be set to the following expression: 

```
= UserFunctionClassName.ConvertToBitmap(Parameters.url.Value)
```
Note that the report parameter holds the URL for the picture.

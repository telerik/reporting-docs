## Description

In different scenarios, data may not an have exact schema to be used for designing a report. In such cases, you can use the fact that the [Table/List/Crosstab item](../table-working-with-table-cross-table-list-items) can visualize 3D data.

- [Basic Concepts](../table-understanding-table-items)
- [Understanding Crosstab Areas](../table-understanding-crosstab-areas)
- [Understanding table Cells, Rows and Columns](../table-understanding-cells-rows-columns)

  
## Solution

The idea is to create a data source describing the data in terms of columns, rows and content, which should result in a flattened tabular representation of data like:

```
columnName,rowIndex,cellContent
column1,1,11
column2,1,21
column3,1,31
column1,2,12
column2,2,22
column3,2,32
```

Then you can add a Table/List/Crosstab item with dynamic row and column groups based on the *columnName* and *rowIndex* fields.  

The attached demo report illustrates the settings. The report can be previewed in the [Standalone Report Designer](../standalone-report-designer) of Telerik Reporting R1 2017 and newer.

Note the scenarios requiring you to create or modify a report at run-time are discussed inÂ [Modifying or Creating a report at Run-Time](./modifying-or-creating-a-report-at-run-time).

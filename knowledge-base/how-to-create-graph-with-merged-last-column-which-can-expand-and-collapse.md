## Description

This KB article explains the steps to create a graph whose last column contains merged values. It can collapse and expand on click.

## Solution

1. Add a [report parameter ]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/report-parameters/overview%})from type _Boolean_. Set it as follows:

	- **AutoRefresh** : True
	- **Name** : *paramMerged*
	- **Value** : *True*

1. Add the [Graph]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/graph/overview%}). Click on the *barSeries* and from the **Property** grid -> **Layout** -> expand **MergedDataPoints**. Apply the setting below:

	- **MergeModel**: *SingleSlice* 
	- **TresholdMode**: *Count* 
	- **TresholdValue**:

	`= IIf(Parameters.paramMerged.Value = "True", 5, 120)`

	In this [expression]({% slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/overview %}), the value which will be set when the report parameter is *True* is 5 and stands for the number of Series (with highest values) that will be separately displayed - the rest will be merged. 120 stands for the value of the columns that will be shown when we would like to display all the Series in the Graph - it should be bigger than the total number of columns.

1. Add a textbox and set its **Value** as follows:

	`= IIf(Parameters.paramMerged.Value = 'True', "+", "-")`

	This way, **+** will be shown when the columns are merged and **-** when they are expanded.

1. Add a [Drillthrough Report Action]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/adding-interactivity-to-reports/actions/drillthrough-report-action%}) to the textbox which will point to the same report (i.e. to itself):  **Action** -> **Navigate to Report** -> **Select a report source** -> **URL or file** -> fill the path to the report ->**Edit Parameters:**

	- **Parameter Name**: paramMerged
	- **Parameter Value**: = Parameters.paramMerged.Value = 'False'

The result will be:

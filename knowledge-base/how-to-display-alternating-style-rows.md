## Environment
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Product</td>
		<td>Progress® Telerik® Reporting </td>
	</tr>
</table>


## Description
Many production level reports use an alternating row style as an aid to readability. This technique is used in the ProductCatalog sample report.

## Solution
This look can be achieved with [conditional formatting](../styling-conditional-formatting) by setting up a rule that fires on every other line.

1. Select the detail section of your report.

2. Select the **ConditionalFormatting** property in the [Context Menu](../ui-context-menu) or the Property Grid.

3. Click the **New Rule** button.

4. Enter the expression "= RowNumber()%2"

5. Select the equal "=" operator from the drop down list.

6. Enter the value as "=1".

7. Click the **Style** button.

8. Click the **Background** style item.

9. Enter the color as "#F0F0F0".

10. Click **OK** to close each of the open dialogs.

The same styling can be achieved with a [Table/Crosstab/List]({% slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/table-crosstab-list/overview %}). For the purpose **at step 1** select all items in a row of the Table/Crosstab/List item, and proceed with the next steps.

## Notes
The expression used **at step 4** is a [Data function](../expressions-data-functions) working in a specific [data scope](../expressions-scope), which depends on the report's layout. To assure the proper evaluation of the expression you can use the name of the report or a group as an argument for the RowNumber function (scope).

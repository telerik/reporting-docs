## Environment
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Product</td>
		<td>Progress® Telerik® Reporting </td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Solution
Usually grouping is used to group the data together by some criteria. To allow different sets of data within a single report you can use [SubReport](../report-items-sub-report) items or [Table/CrossTab/List]({% slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/table-crosstab-list/overview %}) items. Each of those items can have a separate data source and use its own groupings.

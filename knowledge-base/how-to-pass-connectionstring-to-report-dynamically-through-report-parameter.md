## Description
Sometimes it is necessary to change dynamically the connection string of a report and/or data item.

## Solution
The requirement can be achieved without writing additional code, **_directly in the report definition_** using dedicated report parameters. Here are the steps:

1. In the report definition [introduce a new Report Parameter]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/report-parameters/how-to-add-report-parameters%}) (for example _ConnectionStringParameter_) - the connection string will be passed to the Report via this parameter.  
2. In the Report or other [Data item]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-items/overview%}) (Table, List, etc.) where the connection string is supposed to be changed dynamically introduce a new [Binding]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/bindings%}) as shown below:  

	```XML
	Property path                   |   Expression

	DataSource.ConnectionString     |   = Parameters.ConnectionStringParameter.Value
	```

## Notes
The _DataSource.ConnectionString_ property is not listed in the dropdown and must be typed manually.

The proposed approach cannot be used to modify the Connection String of Report Parameter -\> AvailableValues -\> DataSource as report parameters do not expose Bindings.

The same approach can be used to modify the _SelectCommand_ Property of the SqlDataSource. The _DataSource.SelectCommand_ should be set in the above code snippet in this case.

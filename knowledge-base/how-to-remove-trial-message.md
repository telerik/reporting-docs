## Solution
After the license is purchased you need to download the Telerik Reporting DEV installer from your [Telerik account -> Downloads](https://www.telerik.com/account/product-download?product=REPORTING). 
You can refer to this help article - [How to download Telerik Reporting installer]({%slug telerikreporting/installation%}#how-to-download-telerik-reporting-installer). 
The installer will replace the trial version. Choose **Purchase** from **Licence** dropdown menu and you will be able to download the .msi file.

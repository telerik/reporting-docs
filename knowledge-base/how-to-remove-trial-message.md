## Solution

After purchasing the Developer license, you need to download the Telerik Reporting DEV installer from your [Telerik account -> Downloads](https://www.telerik.com/account/product-download?product=REPORTING). Refer to the Documentation article - [How to download Telerik Reporting installer]({%slug telerikreporting/installation%}#msi-installation) for instructions. Select `Purchase` from the `Licence` dropdown menu and you will be able to download the developers `.msi` file.

The installer will replace the trial version with the developer's one.

For additional details, you may also check the [Upgrading Trial to Purchase]({%slug telerikreporting/licensing%}#upgrading-from-trial-to-developer) article section.

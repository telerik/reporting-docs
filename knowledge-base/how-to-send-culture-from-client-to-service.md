## Description
How to pass the desired culture through an AJAX call from the HTML5 Report Viewer client to the server

## Solution
The culture that is respected server side is taken from the *deviceInfo["CurrentCulture"]* property. If this property is not provided, the culture would be taken from the culture settings of the server. Currently, this property could be modified in the event [jQuery.ajaxPrefilter](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajaxprefilter/) that changes the options of the AJAX request before sending it. The culture is added only in the request for [creating the document](../telerik-reporting-rest-documents-api-request-document). The following code adds a handler for the *jQuery.ajaxPrefilter* event that sets the culture to the desired one. The *PlaceCultureStringHere* variable should be a string representing a valid culture.

```javascript
<script>
  $.ajaxPrefilter(function (options, originalOptions, jqXHR) {
      var str = originalOptions.url;
      var documentsSuffix = "documents";
      var isDocumentsUrl = (str.indexOf(documentsSuffix) == str.length - documentsSuffix.length);

      if (isDocumentsUrl) {
          var d = JSON.parse(originalOptions.data);
          d.deviceInfo["CurrentCulture"] = PlaceCultureStringHere;
          options.data = JSON.stringify(d);
      }
  });
</script>
```

The code could be placed in HTML5 Report Viewer's page.

## Notes

- This issue only affects the Windows desktop standalone Report Designer, it does not affect Reporting's processing engine or REST services.
- To check your current version of Telerik Reporting, there are two primary options:
	+ If you’re using the REST service, you can visit the `/api/reports/version/` endpoint (e.g., https://demos.telerik.com/reporting/api/reports/version).
	+ If you’re only using the desktop tooling, check **PC Settings** > **Installed Apps** > expand **Telerik Reporting** item for details.
- If you have any questions or concerns related to this issue, open a new Technical Support case in [Your Account | Support Center](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-center/contact-us/). Technical Support is available to Telerik customers with an active support plan.

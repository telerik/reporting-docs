## Description

The installer fails and I am not able to install Telerik Reporting. How can I fix this issue?

## Cause

The possible reason for this issue is a rights elevation problem that may have occurred.

## Solution  

Run the installer as administrator or from an admin account and generate an installer log to identify the reason for the existing issue:

1. Open a command prompt window by clicking __Start__. In the prompt, type `cmd`. Click `Enter`.             

1. Navigate to the folder in which the Telerik Reporting installer is located.

1. Run the `msiexec /i Telerik_Reporting.msi -l*xv install.log` command where `install.log` stands for and has to be replaced with the directory path and filename where you want to save the log.  Click `Enter`.             

1. After you generate the file, archive it and attach it to a support ticket with more information on the issue.

## Error Messages

## Possible Cause

[Telerik Report Server](../../report-server/introduction) uses the same [Standalone Report Designer](../../report-server/user-guide/report-designer) as the one provided by [Telerik Reporting](https://www.telerik.com/products/reporting.aspx). The versions of the Designer and the Report Server **must** be the same. The designer can be downloaded via **ClickOnce** in Internet Explorer, or by using the download link provided in Chrome, Firefox and other browsers lacking ClickOnce support, by users having access to the *Admin* module of the Report Server ([CALs](https://www.telerik.com/report-server/faq)).  
   
  
## Description

Telerik Reports are **Telerik.Reporting.Report** objects which can be **serialized** in XML(**TRDX** files), or **compressed** XML(**TRDP** files). The XML definition has a schema version that is updated in case of API changes in the released reporting functionality.  

It is important to use the same version of Telerik Reporting Standalone Report Designer as the one of Telerik Report Server, which guarantees you are using the same version of Telerik Reporting engine to create and process reports. 

## Solution

Upgrade/Downgrade the Report Server/Designer so that their versions match. While reports generated by an older version of the designer than the report server can be opened, it cannot open that were edited by designer with a higher version. For the best experience, ensure that the Report Server and the Report Designer's versions match.
  
## Additional Information

- Telerik Reporting Standalone Report Designer can be connected to Telerik Report Server, if they are of the same version. Then the user can log in, and reports can be created, edited and published through the designer;
- You can manually upload and preview reports (TRDX|TRDP files) created with an older version of Telerik Reporting Standalone Report Designer through the Admin Module of Telerik Report Server;

## Notes

- Reports generated by newer versions of Telerik Reporting Standalone Report Designer may not be processed and displayed by Telerik Report Server. In case of XML schema update in Telerik Reporting engine, you will receive an error message pointing the schema version of the report's XML and that you are using an older version of the reporting engine to process that XML.
- Older versions of Telerik Reporting Standalone Report Designer may let you connect them to a newer version of Telerik Report Server, but the designer may malfunction and not let you accomplish your task.

## Description

When attempting to sign into the Telerik website, several errors may appear in the browser console. The issue persists across different browsers and devices. Clearing the browser's cache or using incognito mode might temporarily allow for successful login, but the problem reoccurs.

## Cause

This issue can arise from various browser-related problems including outdated browser versions, stored cache and cookies, disabled JavaScript or cookies, active browser extensions, or network restrictions.

## Solution

To troubleshoot and potentially resolve login issues on the Telerik website, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the used browser is up-to-date. Check the browser's official website for information on the latest version and update if necessary.
2. Clear the browser's cache and cookies. This step removes saved website data that might be causing the issue.
3. Disable all browser extensions. Extensions can interfere with website functionality, including login processes.
4. Confirm that **JavaScript is enabled** in the browser settings. JavaScript is essential for many website interactions.
5. Ensure that cookies are enabled. Cookies are necessary for maintaining a login session.
6. Try accessing the website again using **incognito** or **private** browsing mode. This mode uses a fresh session without saved cookies or cache.
7. Test the login process with a different browser or device to rule out browser-specific issues.
8. Attempt to access the website from a different network. Some networks may have restrictions that impact website functionality.

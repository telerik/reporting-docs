## Description

How can I create a Map report item with custom-defined shapes?

## Solution

The Map item processes and renders polygon primitives by using the [`ShapeMapSeries`](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.ShapeMapSeries) property, which accepts [Well-known text and Well-known binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry), or [ESRI Shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) as a source. Since creating __ESRI Shapefiles__ requires additional tools, the suggested implementation will use the WKT polygon representation. The resulting report will display three American states whose coordinates will be obtained from a CSV data source.

1. You will use the Choropleth wizard that will create the ShapeMap series instance. Start it either by selecting the __Choropleth Wizard__ icon from the **Data Presentation Templates** section or from the __Insert__ menu in the [Standalone Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/overview%}).
1. Add a new [CSV data source]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/data-source-wizards/csvdatasource-wizard%}) and name it __statesData__. This data source will hold the information about the state name and their WKT-coordinates. Click **OK** to continue with the data source wizard.
1. On the __Choose a CSV Source__ page, paste the following text in the **Enter CSV as text** tab:

	````
State;WKT
	North Dakota;POLYGON((-104.064281 49.004828,-104.064281 45.945270,-96.557949 45.945270,-96.796902 46.641745,-96.763943 46.935113,-96.840847 47.006332,-96.879299 47.620830,-97.151211 48.176931,-97.105495 48.689066,-97.231838 49.004828,-104.064281 49.004828))
	Wyoming;POLYGON((-111.064309 45.005438,-111.064309 41.006683,-104.066018 41.006683,-104.066018 45.005438,-111.064309 45.005438))
	New Mexico;POLYGON((-109.065510 37.006785,-109.051777 31.332360,-108.208414 31.333407,-108.208493 31.783783,-106.528509 31.783783,-106.645607 31.896072,-106.614021 31.921719,-106.621574 31.971244,-106.638054 31.982311,-106.618623 32.000556,-103.064750 32.000519,-103.041428 36.500404,-103.002656 36.500529,-103.002220 36.999981,-109.065510 37.006785))

	>The WKT consists of closed polygons, that is, the last point coincides with the first one, which are enumerated in a counter-clockwise order. For more information, refer to the [OGC 10-032r8](https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=56866) specification.

	Click __Next__ when ready.

1. On the __Configure the separators__ page, check only the **Semicolon** option and click __Next__.
1. Skip the __Escape Format__ page by clicking __Next__.
1. On the __CSV Headers__ page, tick the **The CSV has headers** option. Click __Next__.
1. On the __Map columns to type__ page, you will see the `State` and `WKT` columns that have the `string` type. The **Data preview** box will be displaying the formatted output of the CSV data. If everything is correct, close the wizard by clicking __Finish__.
1. The data source wizard closes and the __Choropleth Wizard__ activates, displaying the `statesData` data source you just created. Click __Next__.
1. On the __Choose a spatial data source__ page, select the `Well-Known-Text or Well-Known-Binary field from the data source` option and choose the `WKT` field in the combo-box. Click __Next__.
1. The __Choropleth setup__ expects to configure the fields required to create a Choropleth. Since the data source doesn't include any analytical information that can be used, drag one of the two available fields in the **Color data field** box. Click __Finish__.
1. When the wizard closes, the Map item will display the three polygons that roughly represent the state borders of North Dakota, Wyoming, and New Mexico. Depending on your scenario, you can set up a [`TileProvider`](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.TileProvider) and add some additional styling to the data points and the Map:

Here is how the final Map should look like:

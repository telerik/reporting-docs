## Description
After installing Telerik Reporting, the Visual Studio 2017 Toolbox does not contain any Telerik Reporting wizards.

## Cause\Possible Cause(s)
Тhe assembly that initializes our wizards called **Telerik.Reporting.Design.Components** hasn't got an available path that should be taken from. 

## Solution
During the installation of Telerik Reporting on your machine, the Telerik assemblies were added to GAC. The resolution would be to load the **Telerik.Reporting.Design.Components** assembly manually from there. Here are the steps:

1. Open a report in VS designer and open the Toolbox 

2. Right-click over the Telerik Reporting R1 2019 -> navigate to Choose items... -> .NET Framework Components

3. Click Browse...

4. Navigate to:

	```
	C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\assembly\GAC_MSIL\Telerik.Reporting.Design.Components\v4.0_13.0.19.116__a9d7983dfcc261be
	```
5. Add Telerik.Reporting.Design.Components.dll ([check this screen shot](https://www.screencast.com/t/1tbxrbJja6t)).

After these steps, the wizards should be available for use.

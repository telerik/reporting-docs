## Description

After switching back from using a 2 monito setup to a single monitor, some of the popup windows of the Report Designer that were displayed on my 2nd monitor are now unreachable with the mouse.

How to reposition the windows for single monitor without connecting briefly with the 2nd monitor again?

## Solution

1. Open a report in the Report Designer with the misplaced windows.
1. Open the popup window that needs adjusting.
1. Use the `Alt` + `Space` key combination to focus the window. This will also open the window's context menu.
1. Press the `m` key, now you should be able to move the focused window with the arrow keys.

## Description
This article shows how to avod the warning in Excel indicating that **"The number in the cell is formatted as text or preceded by an apostrophe"**
which appears if you exported integer values which are indicated as String in the report.

## Solution
1. Create a [User Function](../expressions-user-functions) that will return the records with the correct data type:
```CSharp
public static class ReturnTypeClass
{
    public static object ParseString(string str)
    {
        Int32 intValue;
        if (Int32.TryParse(str, out intValue))
            return intValue;
        else return str;
    }
}
```

2. [Register the User Function](../standalone-report-designer-extending-configuration).
For example, if you are using the Standalone designer, you will need to add this piece of code in the **Telerik.ReportDesigner.exe.config** file:
```XML
<Telerik.Reporting>
	<AssemblyReferences>
		<add name="ReturnDataType" />
	</AssemblyReferences>
</Telerik.Reporting>
```

Note that if you render the report in an application, the function must be registered in the configuration file of the application.

3. Set the user function as a value of the field to return it value with the right data type:
```
= ReturnDataType.ReturnTypeClass.ParseString(Fields.NameOfField)
```

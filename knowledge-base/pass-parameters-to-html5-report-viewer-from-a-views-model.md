## Description
When working with the HTML Report Viewer jQuery widget, passing parameters to it from the model of the view can be a bit tricky sometimes. This is due to the serialization and encoding of the model properties. 
The following article describes a general approach that can be used to both achieve the above, and reduce the amount of JSON one needs to type to initialize the viewer.

## Solution
1. Since the parameters dictionary is a child element of the `reportSource` property, as shown in the [HTML5 Report Viewer API Reference]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/api-reference/report-viewer-initialization%}), we will create a custom model that represents the `reportSource` property.

	````C#
public class ReportSourceModel
{
	public string Report { get; set; }
	public Dictionary<string, object> Parameters { get; set; }
}
````

1. Then we can create an instance of this model and conveniently pass all the necessary parameters in our controller

	````C#
public class HomeController : Controller
{
	public IActionResult Index()
	{
		var reportSourceModel = new ReportSourceModel()
		{
			Report = "Barcodes Report.trdp",
			Parameters = new Dictionary<string, object>()
		};
		reportSourceModel.Parameters.Add("MyParameter1", DateTime.Now);
		reportSourceModel.Parameters.Add("MyParameter2", 42);
	
		return View(reportSourceModel);
	}
}
````


1. Once this is done, it is important that **the value we provide to the Report Viewer widget is serialized to JSON, and any HTML encoding is removed**. We can use the `Json.Serialize()` and the `Html.Raw()` methods respectively to accomplish this.

	````HTML
@using Demo.Models
	@model ReportSourceModel

	<div id="reportViewer1">
		loading...
	</div>

	@{
		var reportSource = Html.Raw(Json.Serialize(Model));
	}

	<script type="text/javascript">

		$("#reportViewer1")
			.telerik_ReportViewer({
				id: "reportviewer1",
				serviceUrl: "/api/reports/",
				reportSource: @reportSource
			});
		});
	</script>
````

## Demo Project

You can find a sample project that implements the above in the [following GitHub repo](https://github.com/telerik/reporting-samples/tree/master/HTML5ViewerParametersDemo).

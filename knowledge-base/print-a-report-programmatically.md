## Description

The ability to print a report is widely used feature that a Reporting product cannot go without. The ReportViewers we provide for viewing the reports, come with a **Print** button that takes care of this automatically. However, in case one might want to be in control over the printing - use the exposed methods.  
   
## Solution

### HTML5 Report Viewers

 For the HTML5-based report viewers, you could use the **print** [command](../html5-report-viewer-reportviewer-properties-commands). For example:

 ```js
 $('#printButton').click(function () {
    var rv = $("#reportViewer1").data("telerik_ReportViewer");
    rv.commands.print.exec();
});
 ```

 The example above selects an HTML element with the **printButton id** using jQuery and in the click event handler invokes report viewer **print** command. Note that the **exec()** method of the command needs to be called
 
### Desktop Report Viewers(WinForms/WPF)  
   
  Both Report Viewers come up with out of the box methods for printing the report through code.

   - WinForms Report Viewer - [ReportViewerBase.PrintReport Method](../m-telerik-reportviewer-winforms-reportviewerbase-printreport)

   - WPF Report Viewer - [ReportViewer.PrintReport Method](../m-telerik-reportviewer-wpf-reportviewer-printreport)

 Alternatively, the [ReportProcessor.PrintReport()](../m-telerik-reporting-processing-reportprocessor-printreport) method could also be used. It accepts two parameters  - a [ReportSource](../t-telerik-reporting-reportsource) and the [PrinterSettings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.printing.printersettings?view=net-5.0) that should be used. For example, the following is how we could print the Barcodes Report from the **ReportLibrary** class library project that is can be found in the installation folder of the Telerik Report Designer - {*appFolder*}\Examples\CSharp\.NET Framework\ReportLibrary.
    
```cs
 ReportProcessor reportProcessor = new ReportProcessor();
 reportProcessor.PrintReport(new TypeReportSource() { TypeName = typeof(BarcodesReport).AssemblyQualifiedName }, new PrinterSettings());
``` 

### Legacy ASP.NET Report Viewer  
   
 To print a report through the Legacy ASP.NET ReportViewer, you need to use the built-in print functionality. It depends on the **Adobe Acrobat Reader PDF plugin** (you need it installed to take advantage of true print and not the browsers' printing capabilities) and you have the option to select a printer from a list.   
   

On the client side, you can invoke the print through the ReportViewer client object's *PrintReport()* method:  
   
```html
<form id="form1" runat="server">      
        <telerik:ReportViewer runat="server" id="ReportViewer1"></telerik:ReportViewer>                       
    <script type="text/javascript"> 
        <%=ReportViewer1.ClientID %>.PrintReport(); 
    </script>        
</form> 
```

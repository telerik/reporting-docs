## Description
How to prevent users from accessing the server with the credentials available while examining the Report Viewer's web page source?

## Solution 
Credentials should not be provided as plain text. Either use the [Guest user](https://docs.telerik.com/report-server/implementer-guide/user-management/guest-user) or ask the user of the web page to fill in his/hers credentials before they can access the report.
- Providing an access to the viewer's page to everyone, a Guest user account must be enabled so the end-users can have a read-only connection to the Report Server. 
- Providing an access to limit number of users that would be able to modify the report, they have to be registered as CAL users. The report viewer connected to a report server would need be utilized *only by the person that provides the credentials of its associated CAL user*.

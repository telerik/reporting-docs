## Description

After upgrading to version 19.1.25.521 of Progress Telerik Reporting, the report viewer screen appears blank, displaying only the toolbar. The data exists and operations like downloading work, but the report visualization is missing. Previous versions of the reporting packages worked as expected.

## Cause

The issue arises due to changes in the rendering of the report viewer in version 19.1.25.521. These changes ensure compatibility with [Kendo UI Sass-based themes](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-jquery-ui/documentation/styles-and-layout/sass-themes/overview), which results in some classes, such as `.trv-report-viewer`, no longer being available in the HTML output of the viewer. Consequently, styles meant to control the height or other properties of the report viewer using such classes as CSS selectors are no longer effective.

## Solution

To resolve the issue, use an appropriate CSS selector to apply the necessary styles, and ensure the required Sass-based theme is available. Follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Update the CSS Selector

Replace the `.trv-report-viewer` selector with the ID of your report viewer element (e.g., `#rv1`). Update your CSS as follows:

````html
<style>
    #rv1 {
        width: 100%;
        height: 1000px;
        padding-right: 50px;
    }
</style>
````

### Step 2: Include a Sass-Based Kendo UI Theme

Ensure that a Sass-based Kendo UI theme is referenced in your project. For example, include the Default Ocean Blue theme with the following tag:

````html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href ="https://unpkg.com/@@progress/kendo-theme-default@10.2.0/dist/default-ocean-blue.css"/>
````

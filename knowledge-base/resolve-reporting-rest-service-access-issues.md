## Description

After implementing the [Reporting REST Service]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/overview%}) in an ASP.NET Framework application - [Telerik Reporting REST Service ASP.NET Web API Implementation]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/asp.net-web-api-implementation/overview%}), when the application starts, the error page is displayed with details about a problem with the [ReportsController](/api/telerik.reporting.services.webapi.reportscontrollerbase).

## Error Message

````HTML

## Cause

The issue is likely caused by a greedy route in the route configuration, which interferes with the proper registration and functioning of the Reporting REST service routes. This can occur when the reporting routes are not prioritized in the route registration order.

## Solution

### Solution 1

To resolve this issue, ensure that the reporting routes are registered before the default ones. This action gives them priority and prevents them from being overridden by other more general routes. Use the following steps:

1. Register the reporting routes before any default or other custom routes in your Web API configuration:

    ````CSharp
Telerik.Reporting.Services.WebApi.ReportsControllerConfiguration.RegisterRoutes(config);

    config.Routes.MapHttpRoute(
        name: "DefaultApi",
        routeTemplate: "api/{controller}/{action}/{id}",
        defaults: new { id = RouteParameter.Optional }
    );
````


1. Verify that the [`routeTemplate`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.routing.template.routetemplate?view=aspnetcore-8.0) includes the `{action}` part. Omitting this can cause issues due to multiple actions matching the same route template.

### Solution 2

Change the first path segment included in the route template using the [ReportsControllerConfiguration.RegisterRoutes(HttpConfiguration, String)](/api/telerik.reporting.services.webapi.reportscontrollerconfiguration#Telerik_Reporting_Services_WebApi_ReportsControllerConfiguration_RegisterRoutes_System_Web_Http_HttpConfiguration_System_String_) method overload.

For example, "api" is the default literal path segment in the "api/{controller}" route template. Use this overload and pass a unique path segment (e.g. "reportingapi") to avoid collisions with other Web API services - `Telerik.Reporting.Services.WebApi.ReportsControllerConfiguration.RegisterRoutes(config, "reportingapi");`

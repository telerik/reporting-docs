# Cause\Possible Cause(s)

A Section's **Height** is set to 0(zero).

## Error Message

*Property value is not valid.*

## Description

Setting a section's **Height** property via binding or code to 0 or *tending* to 0 leads to an error after upgrading to **Telerik Reporting R3 2016**.
  
## Solution  

In older versions, a commonly used workaround for shrinking sections was to set the sections' **Height** property via binding or in code behind to 0 or *tending* to 0 (zero) units. We recommend changing the manually set **Height** to **at least 1px.**  

## Notes
  
As of **R3 2016**, sections and Panel items have a **CanShrink properties** that should be used instead of setting manually their **Height properties**.

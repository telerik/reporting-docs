## Description
This article describes how to set the height and width of the ReportViewer component.

## Solution
The Blazor Report Viewer is nested inside a `div` element and will resize itself based on the `div`'s width and height. 
The article [How to Use Blazor Report Viewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/blazor-report-viewer/how-to-use-blazor-report-viewer%}) demonstrates one possible approach: 
a `style` element with the following code:

```
<style>
    #rv1 {
        position: relative;
        width: 1200px;
        height: 600px;
    }

</style>
```
Depending on your application's requirements, you can adjust the position, for example:

```
<style>
   #rv1 {
            width: 85%;
            height: 90%;
            position: absolute;
        }
</style>
```
This solution represents only one of many possible answers that depend on the page's DOM and other CSS configuration.

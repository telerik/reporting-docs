## Description

In some environments, particularly corporate settings, direct access to **nuget.org** or the **Telerik NuGet Feed** may be restricted, hindering the addition of necessary NuGet packages required by Telerik Reporting. 
This article shows how to add an external NuGet package to a Telerik Reporting project in a restricted environment. It also shows the process for including dependencies from local NuGet sources.

## Solution

To set up a Local NuGet package feed, follow these steps:

1. First, you need to log in using your [Telerik licensed account](https://www.telerik.com/account/) and navigate to the Downloads section of the Telerik Reporting product. This way you will be able to download the packages: 
 
    ![Download NuGet Packages from Telerik Account](images/download-nuget-packages.png)    

1. Prepare a Local Folder for NuGet Packages: Create a local folder to store the downloaded `.nupkg` files along with any other dependencies you need. This folder will act as your local NuGet repository.
1. Configure NuGet Package Sources: Add your local folder as a NuGet package source. This allows your project to use the local repository for package restoration and installation.

   - Open your NuGet package manager settings.
   - Click on the **Options** button to manage package sources.

   - Add a new package source by pointing the Source to your local folder containing the `.nupkg` files.

1. Install the Packages: Now, you can select and install the desired packages from your local folder through the NuGet package manager.

Alternatively, you can update the `NuGet.Config` file ensuring that the file includes the local folder as a package source. Here is an example configuration:

````XML
<packageSources>
  <add key="nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
  <add key="_TELERIK" value="https://nuget.telerik.com/v3/index.json" />
  <add key="NuGet Local Folder" value="/var/myofflinepackages/" />
</packageSources>
````

Remember to place all necessary dependencies in your local NuGet folder, avoiding the local NuGet cache to prevent accidental deletion.

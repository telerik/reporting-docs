## Description

The Silverlight ReportViewer is not visible on running the application.

## Cause

As of Telerik Reporting Q1 2014, the Silverlight ReportViewer uses implicit styles. Therefore, when the `Telerik.ReportViewer.Silverlight.xaml` template file is not loaded correctly, the viewer is not displayed.

## Solution  

To solve the issue, double-check if the XAML resources are loaded in the application. For more details about the settings required by the Silverlight ReportViewer, refer to the article on [adding the report viewer to a Silverlight application]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/silverlight-application/how-to-add-report-viewer-to-a-silverlight-application%}).

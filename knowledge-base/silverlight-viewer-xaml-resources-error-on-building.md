## Description

XAML resources-related errors occur on building an application that uses the Silverlight ReportViewer.

## Error Message

The error messages are similar to `The name "XYZControl" does not exist in the namespace "clr-namespace:Telerik.XXXX;assembly=Telerik.XXXX". [path]\Themes\[theme_name]\Telerik.XXXX.xaml`.

## Cause

The possible causes are the following:

* As of Telerik Reporting Q1 2014, the Silverlight ReportViewer uses implicit styles. Therefore, when the `Telerik.ReportViewer.Silverlight.xaml` template file is not loaded correctly, the viewer is not displayed.

* Error messages may occur if the additionally required XAML files are not loaded or are not of a version synchronized with Telerik Reporting.

## Solution  

Double-check if the XAML resources are loaded in the application and [if the dependencies between Telerik Reporting and Telerik UI for Silverlight are considered]({%slug telerikreporting/upgrade/overview%}). For more details about the settings required by the Silverlight ReportViewer, refer to the article on [adding the report viewer to a Silverlight application]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/silverlight-application/how-to-add-report-viewer-to-a-silverlight-application%}).

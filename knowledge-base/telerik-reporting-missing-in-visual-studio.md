## Description

Sometimes you are unable to add any Telerik Reporting items in Visual Studio. This article provides steps on how to solve this issue.

## Cause\Possible Cause(s)

A possible reason for the issue can be that the **Telerik Reporting** and/or **Telerik.CommonPackage** extensions might be disabled or they are not installed. 

## Visual Studio 2022

Occasionally, Visual Studio 2022 tends to fail to install properly the templates deployed in its `\Common7\IDE` folders. This is due to a specific Visual Studio service that fails to stop while the Telerik Reporting installer installs its project/item templates. As a result, the templates cache is never being refreshed and the new templates are not accessible in Visual Studio.

There are two solutions:

1. Uninstall the current Telerik Reporting installation. Restart your machine. Install Telerik Reporting again.
1. Using the Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio 2022 (started as Administrator), type `devenv.exe /installvstemplates`. This should force Visual Studio to install the templates and invalidate the templates' cache.

## Visual Studio 2019

Navigate to **Extensions** -> **Manage Extensions**. Under **Installed**,  find the aforementioned extensions and mark them as **Enabled**. 

If there aren't any Telerik extensions, locate the `Telerik.Reporting.VsX.vsix` under `%programfiles(x86)%\Progress\Telerik Reporting [Version]\Bin\VS2019` and run it. It should install all necessary extensions.

## Visual Studio 2017 and 2015

Navigating to **Tools** -> **Extensions and Updates**. Under **Installed**,  find the aforementioned extensions and mark them as **Enabled**.

If there aren't any Telerik extensions, locate the `Telerik.Reporting.VsX.vsix` under ` %programfiles(x86)%\Progress\Telerik Reporting [Version]\Bin\VS2017 ( or 2015)` and run it. It should install all necessary extensions.

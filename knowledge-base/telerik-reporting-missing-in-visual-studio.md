## Description
Sometimes you are unable to add any Telerik Reporting items in Visual Studio. This articles provides steps on how to solve this issue.

## Cause\Possible Cause(s)
A possible reason for the issue can be that the **Telerik Reporting** and/or **Telerik.CommonPackage** extensions might be disabled or they are not installed. 

## Visual Studio 2019
Navigate to **Extensions** -> **Manage Extensions**. Under **Installed**,  find the aforementioned extensions and mark them as **Enabled**. 

If there aren't any Telerik extensions, locate the **Telerik.Reporting.VsX.vsix** under
```
 %programfiles(x86)%\Progress\Telerik Reporting [Version]\Bin\VS2019
 ```
 and run it. It should install all necessary extensions.

## Visual Studio 2017 and 2015
Navigating to **Tools** -> **Extensions and Updates**. Under **Installed**,  find the aforementioned extensions and mark them as **Enabled**. 

If there aren't any Telerik extensions, locate the **Telerik.Reporting.VsX.vsix** under
```
 %programfiles(x86)%\Progress\Telerik Reporting [Version]\Bin\VS2017 ( or 2015)
 ```
 and run it. It should install all necessary extensions.

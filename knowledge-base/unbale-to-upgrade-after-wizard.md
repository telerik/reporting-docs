## Description

The website Telerik Reporting project is not upgraded after running the Upgrade Wizard.

## Cause

The [Upgrade Wizard]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/upgrade-wizard%}) as well as all Telerik Reporting Wizards and Designers are not designed to handle website projects because websites handle assembly references in a different way.

## Solution  

Manually add viewers or upgrade the website. Design reports in an external `ClassLibrary` project           that is referenced by the website project. For more information, refer to the article on [upgrading Telerik Reporting projects]({%slug telerikreporting/upgrade/overview%}).

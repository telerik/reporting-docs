## Environment

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Product</td>
			<td>Progress® Telerik® Reporting</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>.Net Framework</td>
			<td>Version 4.8</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


## Description

The initial page load works fine and it connects to the Reporting REST API successfully. However, some page actions within the report designer appear to refresh the page.

For example, clicking on the menu and selecting _New Report_ works fine and brings up the "Create a Report" popup window. However, clicking the Save/Cancel buttons on that popup causes the page to refresh which then appears to restart the report designer.

Another example is when setting the designer's option `skipOnboarding: false`. The buttons on the onboarding popup cause the page refresh and the report designer restarts, only to reopen the onboarding popup again (creating a loop you can't progress past).

## Solution

It is necessary to extract the `<div>` place holder of the designer outside the ASPX Form element. The scripts may be extracted as well, althought even when left inside the Form they won't cause the page to reload.

The [Web Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/web-report-designer/overview%}) is a pure jQuery widget and needs to live outside the ASPX Form in order to behave as expected, without making post-back requests.

## Cause

This problem happens when you are trying to deploy an MVC 5 project which utilizes Telerik Reporting WebAPI REST service. 

Usually, the MVC 5 project is also referencing the Web API 2 assemblies while the reports service is built against Web API 1 assemblies. 

For this reason, several assembly binding redirects have to be added in order the service to start properly.  
   
## Description  

After deploying a WebRole which utilizes Telerik Reporting WebAPI REST Service to Windows Azure, the role starts restarting and goes into a cycling state. 
   
## Solution
  
- Add a new file named **[MyWebRoleName].dll.config** to the Web Role project at the same level as the **web.config** file is.

- Set its **Copy to Output Directory** property to **Copy always**.

- Add the following assembly binding redirects:  

```XML
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<configuration>
 <runtime>
    <assemblyBinding xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1"> 
 
     <dependentAssembly>
       <assemblyIdentity name="System.Web.Http" publicKeyToken="31bf3856ad364e35"/>
       <bindingRedirect oldVersion="0.0.0.0-5.0.0.0" newVersion="5.0.0.0"/>
     </dependentAssembly>
 
     <dependentAssembly>
       <assemblyIdentity name="System.Net.Http.Formatting" publicKeyToken="31bf3856ad364e35"/>
       <bindingRedirect oldVersion="0.0.0.0-5.0.0.0" newVersion="5.0.0.0"/>
     </dependentAssembly>
 
    </assemblyBinding>
 </runtime>
</configuration>
```

> Check the exact versions of the referenced *System.Web.Http* and *System.Net.Nttp.Formatting* assemblies in order to setup the binding redirects correctly.

- Publish the solution to Windows Azure.   

## Notes

Keep in mind that Windows Azure Web Apps (in **Free** and **Shared** modes) restricts applications to access some system resources, including GDI API, and rendering extensions as PDF would not be able to produce a document.

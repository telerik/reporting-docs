## Description

When connecting the WinForms ReportViewer to Telerik Report Server or Reporting REST service, an error for a failed attempt occurs.

## Error

`Attempt by method 'Telerik.Reporting.Services.HttpClient.HttpRequestHelper.GetResponseFromPost(System.Net.Http.HttpResponseMessage)' to access method 'Telerik.Reporting.Services.HttpClient.HttpRequestHelper.GetResponseFromPost <T> (System.Net.Http.HttpResponseMessage, System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable 1 <System.Net.Http.Formatting.MediaTypeFormatter>)' failed.`

## Cause

The WinForms ReportViewer requires [`Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client/4.0.30506) that is suitable for .NET4.

## Solution  

Install the `Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client` trough the [Visual Studio Package Manager Console](https://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-manager-console). For more information, refer to the article on [using the WinForms Report Viewer with the Report Server]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/windows-forms-application/how-to-use-windows-forms-report-viewer-with-report-server%}).

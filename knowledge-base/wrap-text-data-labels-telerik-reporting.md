## Description

When using the [Graph Report Item]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/graph/overview%}) with the [Column chart]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/graph/chart-types/column-charts/overview%}) type, sometimes the text in data labels is too long, and it exceeds the column's width. This KB article demonstrates how to wrap text in data labels for a Graph Report Item or how to format long text in data labels to fit within a column in a graph report.

## Solution

To wrap text in data labels for a Column chart in the Graph Report Item, use the [built-in text functions]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/expressions-reference/functions/text-functions%}) to insert a new line character in the `DataPointLabels` text. 

1. Select the `BarSeries`.
2. Set the `DataPointLabel` with the appropriate `Replace` function to insert a new line character where needed. For example:

````
= Replace(Fields.CategoryNamePlusPercent, ' ', '
')
````

This function replaces spaces with a new line character, effectively wrapping the text.

Additionally, consider extending expressions for more complex formatting needs. For more details, refer to the [Extending Expressions](%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/extending-expressions/overview%) section in the documentation.

An alternative approach is to rotate the labels and center the text to fit the data labels within the column's width.

## Suggested Workarounds

- **Rotate the labels**: Apply rotation to the labels to make more space for the text. This can be done from the properties of the `Graph Report Item`.
- **Custom functions**: For more advanced scenarios, create custom functions to format the data labels' text.

## Notes

Experiment with text wrapping and rotation to find the best presentation for your specific case. Adjustments might be needed based on the actual data and chart size.

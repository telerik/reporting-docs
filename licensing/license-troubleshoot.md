# Troubleshoot License Problems

In rare scenarios, clients keep getting Licensing watermarks in some environments, while when building the project, everything has been verified to work correctly:

 - There is a proper `telerik-license.txt` file.
 - Build logs show our product has been detected.
 - At runtime, the Report Viewers still show a Licensing watermark.

## Telerik Licensing Diagnostics

Starting with __Telerik.Licensing__ version 1.6.24, we provide a utility that does runtime diagnostics.

1. Install `Telerik.Licensing` library __1.6.24__ or later from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Telerik.Licensing). We recommend the latest version of the package.

	>If your project targets the `.NET Framework`, you may need to add a binding redirect to your configuration file. If you use a newer version, change the code accordingly:
	>
	>````XML
<dependentAssembly>
	<assemblyIdentity name="Telerik.Licensing.Runtime" publicKeyToken="98bb5b04e55c09ef" culture="neutral"/>
	<bindingRedirect oldVersion="0.0.0.0-1.6.24.0" newVersion="1.6.24.0"/>
</dependentAssembly>
````


1. To enable the runtime diagnostics, please call the method `Telerik.Licensing.TelerikLicensing.EnableDiagnostics()` as early as possible before loading your Telerik Report Viewers:

	For example, you may add the code in the startup file of the project. In ASP.NET projects, you may use the `Application_Start` event handler in the `Global.asax` file. Here is a sample code:

	````CSharp
protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
	{
	    string logPath = Server.MapPath("~/TelerikLicensing.log");
	    var writer = File.AppendText(logPath);
	    writer.AutoFlush = true;
	    Console.SetOut(writer);
	    Telerik.Licensing.TelerikLicensing.EnableDiagnostics();
	}
````

	The above code will add the Licensing validation logs to the file 'TelerikLicensing.log' in your application's main folder.

1. (_optional_) If you make a call to the method `TelerikLicensing.Register()`, do this after enabling diagnostics with the above code line.
1. Load a page with Telerik Report Viewer, then collect the content of the aggregated licensing log in Telerik.Licensing.TelerikLicensing.Diagnostics.

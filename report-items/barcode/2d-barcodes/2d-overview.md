# Two-Dimensional Barcodes Overview

The matrix barcode is a two-dimensional (2D) way of representing information.

It can also be referred to as a 2D barcode or simply a 2D code. 2D barcodes are similar to linear (1D) barcodes but can represent more data per unit area.

Currently, the Barcode report item supports the following matrix barcode types:

| Barcode | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
|[QR Code]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/barcode/barcode-types/2d-barcodes/qr-code/overview%})|One of the most popular 2D barcodes with wide commercial application.|
|[Swiss QR Code]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/barcode/barcode-types/2d-barcodes/swiss-qr-code/overview%})|A barcode based on the QR symbology used exclusively in Switzerland payment slips, named QR-bill.|
|[PDF417]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/barcode/barcode-types/2d-barcodes/pdf417/overview%})|A stacked linear 2D barcode used by U.S. Postal Services, Department of Homeland Security, airline industry and others.|

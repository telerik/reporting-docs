# Gauge Report Item Overview

>note The Gauge Report Item was added with the R2 2023 Release.

The Gauge report item is used to display the key performance indicators (KPIs) that track the amount of progress made towards achieving the targets or goals.

## Gauge Types

Currently, the `Gauge` report item supports only `Radial` gauges.

### Radial

Radial gauges are circular, or degrees of circular, and resemble speedometers. The gauge pointers are often needles, but can be markers or bars too. The radial gauge is typically used when you want to express the data as a velocity.

Telerik Reporting provides the following Radial Gauge report item presets out of the box:

* Single-Range

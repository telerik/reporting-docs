# Area Charts Overview

An Area chart displays a series as a set of points connected by a line with the whole area filled in under the line. 

Area charts are appropriate for visualizing data that fluctuates over a period of time and can be useful for emphasizing trends. Values that don't vary too wildly work best for Area charts. 

The following image shows an example of a Stacked Area chart:

## Types 

* __Stacked Area Charts__&mdash;An Area chart where multiple series are stacked vertically. If there is only one series in the chart, the Stacked Area chart will appear in the same way as an Area chart. 
* __100% Percent Stacked Area Charts__&mdash;An Area chart where multiple series are stacked vertically to fit the entire chart area. If there is only one series in the chart, the Stacked Area chart will appear in the same way as an Area chart. 
* __Smooth Area Charts__&mdash;An Area chart where the data points are connected by a smooth line instead of a regular line. Smooth Area charts are suitable for displaying trends rather than values of individual data points.

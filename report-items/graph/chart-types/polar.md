# Polar Charts

A Polar chart displays series as sets of data points that are grouped by category on a 360-degree circle and represent the values by the distance of the point as measured from the center of the circle. 

The farther the data point is from the center, the greater its value is. Category labels are displayed on the perimeter of the chart. 

The following image displays a Rose Polar chart:

## Types 

The Graph supports the following Polar chart types: 

* __Line Polar Charts__&mdash;A Polar chart in which the data points are connected by a line.
* __Area Polar Charts__&mdash;A Polar chart in which the data points are connected by a line with the area below the line filled with color.
* __Rose Polar Charts__&mdash;A Polar chart in which the data points are represented by bars drawn in a polar coordinate system.

## Creating Radar Polar Charts with the Radar Chart Wizard

In this section, you will learn how to create a Rose chart with our Rose Chart Wizard. This is a variation of the Polar (Radar) Chart type and is located under the `Other` Charts in the main menu.
We are going to display the LineTotal of the Product Categories by Years. The final report will look like the image above.

The sample report will use a pre-defined SqlDataSource that connects to the example AdventureWorks database. The query that returns the needed fields is the following:

````SQL
SELECT
	[Production].[ProductCategory].[Name] AS 'Category',
	[Sales].[SalesOrderHeader].[OrderDate],
	[Sales].[SalesOrderDetail].[LineTotal]
FROM
	[Production].[Product] INNER JOIN
	[Production].[ProductSubcategory] ON [Production].[Product].[ProductSubcategoryID] = [Production].[ProductSubcategory].[ProductSubcategoryID] INNER JOIN
	[Production].[ProductCategory] ON [Production].[ProductSubcategory].[ProductCategoryID] = [Production].[ProductCategory].[ProductCategoryID] INNER JOIN
	[Sales].[SalesOrderDetail] ON [Production].[Product].[ProductID] = [Sales].[SalesOrderDetail].[ProductID] INNER JOIN
	[Sales].[SalesOrderHeader] ON [Sales].[SalesOrderDetail].[SalesOrderID] = [Sales].[SalesOrderHeader].[SalesOrderID] AND [Sales].[SalesOrderDetail].[SalesOrderID] = [Sales].[SalesOrderHeader].[SalesOrderID] AND 
	[Sales].[SalesOrderDetail].[SalesOrderID] = [Sales].[SalesOrderHeader].[SalesOrderID]
````


To create the Polar chart by using the Polar Chart Wizard: 

1. Add Rose Chart as shown in the image below:

	![Add Rose Polar Chart Wizard](images/PolarChartWizardAdd.png)

1. Select the SqlDataSource, or create it with the **Add New Data Source...** button and by using the query above:

	![Add DataSource to the Rose Polar Chart](images/PolarChartWizardDataSource.png)

1. Arrange the Rose Chart:

	1. Drag the __Category__ field to **Series**.
	1. Drag the __OrderDate.Year__ field to **Categories**.
	1. Drag the __LineTotal__ field to **Values**. The wizard will automatically apply the `Sum` [aggregate function]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/expressions-reference/functions/aggregate-functions%}).

	![Arrange the Polar Chart](images/PolarChartWizardArrangeFields.png)

1. The `LineTotal` value is large, so let's change the `Data > Y` [expression]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/overview%}) of `barSeries` that is currently `=Sum(Fields.LineTotal)` to `=ISNULL(Sum(Fields.LineTotal), 0) / 1000.0`. Note that a `Null` check is also included and the `Null` values to be replaced with a `0` (zero).

1. The `LineTotal` values for the `Bikes` category are significantly higher than the other three categories, so let's use a Logarithmic Scale for the `RadialAxis` to improve the user experience:
	1. Select the **Graph** > **Presentation** > **CoordinateSystems**, and click on the ellipses (**...**) beside the property. This action will open the **GraphCoordinateSystem Collection Editor**.
	1. Go to the **RadialAxis** property and select **<New Axis with Logarithmic Scale>** from the drop-down.
	1. Expand the **RadialAxis1** property and change the **LabelAngle** to **90** degrees to improve the appearance.

	The following image with the proper fields highlighted shows how the above settings look in the designer:

## Creating Radar Polar Charts Manually

This section will show how to manually create a Polar chart.

### 1. Add the Graph

To add a new Graph report item to the report, refer to the article [getting started with the Graph report item]({% slug graph_item_get_started %}).

### 2. Set the SeriesGroups Hierarchy

Now you can set the **SeriesGropus** hierarchy of the Stacked Area chart: 

1. Open the __SeriesGroups__ collection editor and click __Add__.
1. Set the __Groupings__ to `=Fields.OrderDate.Year`.
1. Set the __Sortings__ to `=Fields.OrderDate.Year`.
1. Set the __Name__ to `seriesGroup1`.

### 3. Set the CategoryGroups Hierarchy

Next, you will have to define the **CategoryGroups** hierarchy of the Stacked Area chart:

1. Open the __CategoryGroups__ collection editor and click __Add__.
1. Set the __Groupings__ to `=Fields.Category`.
1. Set the __Sortings__ to `=Fields.Category`.
1. Set the __Name__ to `categoryGroup1`. 

### 4. Configure the Coordinate System

Here you will specify the coordinate system details:

1. Open the __CoordinateSystems__ collection editor and __Add__ a new __PolarCoordinateSystem__.
1. Leave the __Name__ to `polarCoordinateSystem1`.
1. Set the __RadialAxis__ to __New Axis Logarithmic Scale__.
1. Set the __AngularAxis__ to __New Axis with Category Scale__.

### 5. Configure the Series

In this step, you will configure the series of the chart:

1. Open the __Series__ collection editor and __Add__ new __BarSeries__.
1. Set the __CategoryGroup__ to __categoryGroup1__.
1. Set the __SeriesGroup__ to __seriesGroup1__.
1. Set the __CoordinateSystem__ to __polarCoordinateSystem1__.
1. Set the __ArrangeMode__ to __Clustered__.
1. Set the __Y__ value to `=ISNULL(Sum(Fields.LineTotal), 0) / 1000.0`.

### 6. Style the Appearance

To set the color palette, format the labels, define the values of the legend, and elaborate on any other styling options, refer to the section on [formatting the Graph]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/graph/formatting-a-graph/style-resolving-fallback-algorithm%}).

## Design Considerations

Polar charts are most commonly used to graph polar data where each data point is determined by an angle and a distance.

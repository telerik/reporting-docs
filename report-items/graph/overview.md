# Graph Overview

The Graph report item is a native Telerik Reporting item which allows you to generate different [Chart types (objects)]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/graph/chart-types/overview%}) and visually present large volumes of aggregated information. 

The Graph is most often used for building powerful OLAP and Pivot charts and provides powerful mechanisms for using expressions for data points, conditional formatting, and styling options, including interactivity. A chart produced by the Graph report item can have multiple and different chart series and coordinate systems. 

>* As of Telerik Reporting Q1 2013, the Graph has superseded the Chart report item being the more advanced between the two.  
>* As of Telerik Reporting Q2 2013, the [Chart report item has been deprecated]({% slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/chart-(obsolete) %}) and is now obsolete.

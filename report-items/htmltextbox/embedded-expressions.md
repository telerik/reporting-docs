# Embedded Expressions in HtmlTextBox

The HtmlTextBox supports [embedded expressions]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/overview%}) for mail merge functionality.

Embedded expressions enable you to get and insert data-driven information directly into the HtmlTextBox report item and produce customized reports and mail merging.

After the expression is evaluated or replaced, the value of the HtmlTextBox must be valid XHTML.

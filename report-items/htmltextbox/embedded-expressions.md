# Embedded Expressions

The HtmlTextBox supports [embedded expressions]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/overview%}) for mail merge functionality. Embedded expressions give you the freedom to get and insert data-driven information directly into the text box report item to produce customized reports and mail merging. 

After the expression evaluation/replacement, the value of the HtmlTextBox must be valid XHTML.

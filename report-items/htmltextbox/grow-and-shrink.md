# Growing and Shrinking

By default, the HtmlTextBox report item has its size set.

To allow the HtmlTextBox to expand vertically based on its content, set its [`CanGrow`](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.TextItemBase#Telerik_Reporting_TextItemBase_CanGrow) property to its default `True` value. 

To allow the HtmlTextBox to shrink based on its content, set its [`CanShrink`](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.TextItemBase#Telerik_Reporting_TextItemBase_CanShrink) property to `True`. By default, `CanShrink` is set to `False`. Note that the HtmlTextBox will always grow to accommodate the first line of text even when `CanGrow` is `False`.

# Known Limitations
 
>* The HtmlTextBox respects only inline styles.
>* The HtmlTextBox works with the text formatting options only.
>* The HtmlTextbox is rendered as plain text with no formatting in Excel.
>* RTL (Right to Left) is not supported.
>* The HyperLink (`<a>` tag) is interactive (acts as an actual hyperlink) only under an HTML rendering extension. To add links in PDF, XLSX, DOCX, PPTX files and HTML, XAML, IMAGE renderings for the different Report Viewers, you can use a [Hyperlink Action]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/adding-interactivity-to-reports/actions/hyperlink-action%}).
>* Any limitations of the HtmlTextBox in specific export formats are reflected in the respective topic in the [Design considerations for Report Rendering]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/rendering-and-paging/design-considerations-for-report-rendering/overview%}) help section.

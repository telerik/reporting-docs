# HtmlTextBox Overview

The HtmlTextBox report item enables you to insert HTML-formatted text into a report. You can specify the HTML value at design time either through a WYSIWYG editor or through an expression editor, or retrieve it from a data source by using any simple or complex expression that evaluates to correctly formatted HTML. 

With the HtmlTextBox report item, you can: 

* Define colors, fonts, and other behavior on any subset of text within a single HtmlTextBox to create a mail merge or a template for text in your report. 

* Use multiple paragraphs inside a single text box. 

* Set an alignment value for any individual string of text. 

For the full list with special entities like "?" and TAB and their expression, refer to this [w3.org page](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml-special.ent).

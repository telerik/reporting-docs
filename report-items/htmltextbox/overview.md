# HtmlTextBox Overview

The HtmlTextBox report item enables you to insert HTML-formatted text into a report.

You can specify the HTML value at design time either through a WYSIWYG editor or through an expression editor, or retrieve it from a data source by using any simple or complex expression that evaluates to correctly formatted HTML.

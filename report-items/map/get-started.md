# Getting Started with the Map Report Item

This guide shows how to add the Telerik Reporting Map report item in reports.

The simplest way to add a __Map__ item to your report is to run the `Map Wizard`. After you add a Map item to the design surface of the [Visual Studio Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/overview%}), you can click its elements to edit the selected element's properties in the *Properties* grid. In the [Standalone Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/overview%}) you can use the ribbon tools.

## Description

How can I add a Choropleth map to my report by using the Choropleth Wizard and the Standalone or the Visual Studio Report Designer?

## Solution

To achieve the scenario: 

1. Run the Choropleth Wizard. As a result, the Map is added to the design surface. 
1. Click the Map to edit the properties of the selected elements in the **Properties** grid. 

The next steps vary depending on whether you are using the Telerik [Visual Studio Report Designer](#visual-studio-report-designer) or the [Standalone Report Designer](#standalone-report-designer) tool. 

### Visual Studio Report Designer   

To add a Choropleth map in the Visual Report Designer: 

1. Open the Visual Studio toolbox. 
1. From the **Telerik Reporting** tab, select the **Choropleth Wizard**.
1. Click the design surface at the location where you want to place the upper-left corner of the map. As a result, the Choropleth Wizard opens. 
1. Follow the prompts from the Choropleth Wizard.
1. When you click **Finish**, a new Map item will be created on the design surface and the Map will be rendered with the real data. The initial extent of the Map will depend on the data you are using. 

### Standalone Report Designer

To add a Choropleth map in the Standalone Report Designer:

1. From the ribbon, open the **Insert** tab. 
1. Select the **Choropleth** item. As a result, the Choropleth Wizard opens. 
1. Follow the prompts from the Choropleth Wizard.
1. When you click **Finish**, a new Map item will be created on the design surface and the Map will be rendered with the real data. The initial extent of the Map will depend on the data you are using.

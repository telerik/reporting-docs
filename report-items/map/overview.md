# Map Overview

The Map report item is a native Telerik Reporting item which allows you to generate different [Chart types (objects)]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-structure/graph/chart-types/overview%}) and visually present large volumes of aggregated information. 

The Graph is most often used for building powerful OLAP and Pivot charts and provides powerful mechanisms for using expressions for data points, conditional formatting, and styling options, including interactivity. A chart produced by the Graph report item can have multiple and different chart series and coordinate systems.

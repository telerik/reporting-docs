## Adding the Report Item 

To [create a new report]({% slug telerikreporting/getting-started/first-steps %}#step-2-create-the-sample-report), use the [Telerik Reporting Report Designer tools]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/overview%}). As a result, the report will automatically add the Report item. 

## Configuring the Default Sections

For the purposes of this guide, add a **Blank report** and [configure its default **Page Header**, **Details**, and **Page Footer** ]({% slug telerikreporting/getting-started/first-steps %}#step-5-set-the-page-header-and-footer). 

Later, you can also add any of the other [Report Sections]({%slug report_structure_groups_sections%}). 

## Using the Report Templates 

To build on top of the report, use the available [Report Templates]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/report-templates%}), which save time when creating reports with consistent layout. The templates also support Wizards which enable you to define the initial settings of the report.

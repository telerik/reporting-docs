# Getting Started with the Report Item 

The `Report` item is a unique report item that is a container for the rest of the report items. It consists of report sections, each one with a different purpose as explained in the article on [Telerik Reporting report sections]({%slug report_structure_groups_sections%}#report-sections).

You may add a Report item to the Desktop Report Designers as follows:

* For the Visual Studio Report Designer you may right-click over the .NET Framework ReportLibrary project and select `Add` > `New item...`. You need to choose the corresponding item from the available items under `Reporting` as shown in the image below:

* For the Standalone Report Designer you may select `File` from the Menu toolbar and choose the corresonding option from the `New` tab as displayed in the image below:

When you create a new report with any of the Telerik Reporting [Report Designer tools]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/overview%}), the report will automatically add the Report item by providing you with the following approaches to do that: 

* (For all Report Designers) Select to add a **Blank report**&mdash;The Blank report contains the **Page Header**, **Details**, and **Page Footer** empty sections by default. You can add any of the other available report sections later. 

	For the specific steps to proceed further on, refer to the [guide on designing and configuring the Blank report sections]({% slug telerikreporting/getting-started/first-steps%}#step-2-create-the-sample-report). 

* (For the desktop Report Designers) Add a Report Template&mdash;The Telerik Reporting [report templates]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/report-templates%}) save time when you create reports with consistent layouts. 

	The templates support the following dedicated wizards that enable you to configure the initial settings of the report: 

	* [Band Report Wizard (step-by-step guide)]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/band-report-wizard/overview%}) for creating reports with layouts based on the report sections.

	* [Label Report Wizard (step-by-step guide)]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/label-report-wizard%}) for creating reports with label layouts.

	* [Invoice Report Wizard (step-by-step guide)]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/invoice-report-wizard%}) for preparing one of the most common business documents, the invoice.

	* [Product Catalog Report Wizard (step-by-step guide)]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/product-catalog-report-wizard%}) for creating one of the most useful business presentation documents, the catalog.


* (For the desktop Report Designers) Convert a report from another reporting format&mdash;If you have already used another reporting tool and want to reuse some of your existing reports, check [whether Telerik Reporting provides automatic converters for them]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/converting-reports-from-other-reporting-solutions/overview%}). 

	If yes, use the [Import Report Wizard step-by-step guide]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/import-report-wizard%}) to proceed with the conversion.

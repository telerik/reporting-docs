# Getting Started with the Report Item

This guide shows how to create and use the Telerik Reporting Report item in the [Standalone Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/overview%}).

* First, you will create the new Report item and add the required sections.
* Then, you will configure the page settings that define the printing properties such as the paper type, size, Watermarks, and so on.
* Next, you will add a simple `CsvDataSource` feeding with data to the report. 
* Following, you will add some paging information to the page sections and sample aggregate information to the header and footer sections of the report.
* Finally, you will style the appearance of the report. 

At the end, you will be able to achieve the following result.

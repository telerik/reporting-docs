# Getting Started with the Report Item 

The Report item is a unique report item that is a container for the rest of the report items. It consists of report sections, each one with a different purpose as explained in [Report Sections]({%slug report_structure_groups_sections%}#report-sections).

## Adding the Report Item 

The Report item is added automatically when you create a new Report with any of our [Report Designer tools]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/overview%}). You may start with:

* Blank report

* Report Template /desktop designers only/

* Converting a Report from another reporting format /desktop designers only/

The `Blank report`, contains three empty sections: `Page Header`, `Details`, and `Page Footer`. You may add any of the other Report Sections later. Check how to add a **Blank report** and [configure its default **Page Header**, **Details**, and **Page Footer** ]({% slug telerikreporting/getting-started/first-steps%}#step-2-create-the-sample-report). 

In the desktop designers, we provide several [`Report Templates`]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/report-templates%}) that save time when creating reports with consistent layout. The templates feature dedicated Wizards that let you choose the initial settings of the report: 

* [`Band Report Wizard`]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/band-report-wizard/overview%}) for creating a report with layout based on report sections

* [`Label Report Wizard`]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/label-report-wizard%}) for creating a report with label layout

* [`Invoice Report Wizard`]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/invoice-report-wizard%}) for preparing one of the most common business documents

* [`Product Catalog Report Wizard`]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/product-catalog-report-wizard%}) for creating one of the most useful business presentation documents

If you have already used another reporting tool and would like to reuse some of your existing reports, check whether we provide automatic converters for them in the [Importing Reports Overview]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/converting-reports-from-other-reporting-solutions/overview%}). If we support your previous reporting, you may use the [`Import Report Wizard`]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/report-wizards/import-report-wizard%}) to start the conversion.

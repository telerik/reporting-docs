The Shape report item supports creating a custom shapes programmatically. The following code snippet shows how to inherit the [ShapeBase](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.Drawing.Shapes.ShapeBase)  class and provide a custom set of __PointF__ array that will form the shape. The points coordinates are relative and do not depend on the item's size or position in the report.

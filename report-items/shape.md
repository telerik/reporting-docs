# Shape Report Item Overview

TheÂ Shape report item displays a single selection of predefined shapes in a report. 

The following screenshot shows a Shape report item with its `ShapeType="Right Arrow"` on the report design surface.

You can use shapes to create visual effects within a report. You can set display and other properties to this item by using the Properties pane. 

The following table lists the `ShapeType` property modes supported by the Shape. 

|Lines|Stars|Arrows|Other
|:---|:---|:---|:---
|Vertical Line|3-ray star|Top Arrow|Ellipse 
|Horizontal Line|4-ray star|Bottom Arrow|Triangle 
|Slant Line|5-ray star|Left Arrow|Square 
|BackSlant Line|6-ray star|Right Arrow|Pentagon 
||8-ray star||Hexagon 
||||Octagon 
||||Cross 

The Shape enables you to create custom shapes programmatically. The following code snippet shows how to inherit the [`ShapeBase`](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.Drawing.Shapes.ShapeBase) class and provide a custom set of `PointF` arrays that will form the Shape. The coordinates of the points are relative and do not depend on the size or position of the item in the report.

You can create the Shape at runtime and add it to a report item container (Section, Panel, or other). The following snippet shows how to instantiate a Shape of the `CustomShape` type:

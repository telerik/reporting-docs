# Group Editor

Choosing a dynamic group from the [Group Explorer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/group-explorer%}), shows a context menu which allows you to alter the           properties of the selected group. Choosing Group properties option, would open a "Edit Table Group" dialog from which you can control Filters, Grouping and Sorting along with specifying GroupKeepTogether.

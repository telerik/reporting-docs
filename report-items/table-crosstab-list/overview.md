# Table Overview

The Table report item is a generalized layout report item which displays report data in cells that are organized into rows and columns. 

The Table report item is an indi vidual [data region]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-items/overview%}) which utilizes its own [`Telerik.Reporting.DataItem.DataSource`](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.DataItem#Telerik_Reporting_DataItem_DataSource) to populate the fields with data. Thus, it defines its own [expression scope]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/expression-scope-%}). The dataset fields are displayed either as detail or grouped data in a grid or in a free-form layout. Each table cell can contain any report item, such as a TextBox, PictureBox, Graph, or another Table template variation.

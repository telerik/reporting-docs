# Word Rendering Design Considerations



The Word Rendering Extension of Telerik Reporting produces __Open XML Word documents__ . The generated documents         are compatible with __Microsoft Word 2007__  or later. Earlier versions of Microsoft Word are not supported. This rendering         extension requires [Third-Party Dependencies]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/third-party-dependencies%}).         The file name extension generated by this renderer is DOCX. After the report is exported, you can edit the contents of the         generated document or print it as usual.       

The Word rendering extension is based on the Image rendering extension, with some differences. For         information common to both formats, see [Image Rendering Design Considerations]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/rendering-and-paging/design-considerations-for-report-rendering/image-rendering-design-considerations%}). This         topic describes features that are specific to the Word rendering extension.       

## Rendering

Report exported to Word appears as a nested table that represents both the report layout and content. Nested           data region items, such as SubReport, Table, Crosstab or List items are rendered as nested tables that reflect the           layout and structure of that data region in the report. Due to the way Word renders these nested items, their borders may be misaligned or appear drawn with double lines if the nested item has its own border style. Other items are rendered as separate cells within the same           table. The item’s value is rendered as content in the table cell. PictureBox, Chart, Barcode and Shape items are           rendered as static images in the cell. URL actions of TextBox items are rendered as hyperlinks, as soon as they           represent absolute URLs. The relative ones are not respected and are not rendered in Word.         

>note Word tables support a maximum of 63 columns. Reports with very complex layout or many misaligned items might             sometimes produce documents exceeding that limit. To avoid this, align your items carefully in the designer, using the             "snap to lines" and "snap to grid" modes whenever possible. To organize many items together in columns and rows             consider using the Table, Crosstab or List report item instead.           


>caution Since report items are rendered as individual table cells they cannot overlap. If you have overlapping items in             the report definition, the resulting document is undefined, i.e. this would break the report layout. If there are no             overlapping items the original layout is preserved. In general, avoid having overlapping items at design-time if you             are planning to export the report to Word.           


## Pagination

Microsoft Word does not support the concept of hard pages. Instead, when the exported document is opened           in Word, Word repaginates it again based on the page size. The rendering extension tries to preserve closely the           original pages of the report, inserting additional page breaks when necessary. However in some rare cases the           repagination performed by Word might interfere with this behavior, resulting in a document with page breaks on           unexpected places or blank pages. To correct this, you can try changing the Word’s pagination by adjusting the           page margins.         

##Page Sizing

When the report is rendered, the page size, orientation and margins are configured in the document                 according to the corresponding properties in the report definition. For ReportBook the page settings of each                 individual report in the book are respected. This can produce a document with varying page sizes and                 orientation per report.               

>note Word supports a maximum page size of 22 inches wide and 22 inches high. If your page is wider than 22 inches,                   some data may not be displayed in Print Layout view.                 


##Page Headers and Footers

Report’s PageHeaderSection and PageFooterSection are rendered as header and footer regions in the document.                 For ReportBook the page sections of each individual report in the book are respected. This can produce a document                 with varying page headers and footers per report.               

Word does not support configuring explicitly the height of headers and footers. Instead they are sized automatically                 according to their content.               

##Page Columns

Newsletter-style multi-column reports are rendered as multiple columns in Word.               

Since Word repaginates the entire document when opening it, the same behavior is applied to multi-column documents                 as well. The rendering extension tries to preserve the original organization of the report in columns by inserting                 column breaks when necessary. However in some rare occasions the repagination performed by Word might interfere with                 this behavior resulting in column breaks on unexpected places or empty columns. To correct this, you can try changing                 the Word’s pagination by adjusting the column spacing or page margins.               

## Styling

The following is a brief description of how styles are rendered in Word.         

*  __Colors__  - Colors are rendered as exact RGB values. Transparent colors with alpha
            channel are not supported.

*  __Borders__  - Borders of report items are rendered as table cell borders. Borders of adjacent report items are
            collapsed automatically, following the Word’s own border collapse rules.

   >note Word application applies a margin value to the table cell by default. This will produce a space between the nested table borders and the parent table borders.                 To remove the space, the margin needs to be removed manually after opening the document in MS Word.
>

*  __Background__  - Background colors are rendered as background shading of table cells. Background images
            are not supported.

*  __Fonts__  - Fonts and their settings are rendered exactly as they are specified in the report definition.
            In order to display correctly a document that uses a specific font, that font must be installed on the client machine. The rendering extension does not provide a fallback mechanism in case of missing fonts.

   >note Text boxes which do not contain a value (contain a null value, empty string, etc.) will be rendered with font size of 1pt.
>

*  __Text__  - Text justification and alignment is preserved when exporting to Word. Note that if a justified text goes from one page to
            another, the last line of the first page will be left-aligned. Text orientation is supported only for the angles of 0, 90 and 270 degrees. Rotated text on other angles is not supported
            and is approximated to the closest match.

*  __HTML__  - HTML text is rendered using Word’s own HTML rendering engine. This might produce a result that is
            slightly different from the output generated in Web browsers.

## Report items

The following rules apply to rendered report items:

* The PictureBox report item's Sizing property should be set to AutoSize for best image quality or the PictureBox.Size should match the               actual image size. In case you get a blurred image at run-time, change the Sizing mode or resize the PictureBox item to match the size of the produced image.             

* The Cross-section item renders its graphical primitives as images. It is recommended to set the *Position*  property to __Front__                 to allow rendering it on top of the other items, otherwise the Word application may apply undesired offset to it.             

## Interactivity

The supported interactivity actions are Navigate to URL and Navigate to Bookmark.         

URL actions on report items are rendered as hyperlinks in the Word document. When you click the hyperlink, the default Web browser opens           and navigates to the specified URL.         

Actions on report sections are not supported.

## Limitations

Text Watermarks do not support __strikethrough__  and __underline__  text decorations.

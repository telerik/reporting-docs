# Styling Report Items Overview

Telerik Reporting uses a built-in styling model that is similar to CSS. The model provides for very fine-grained visual customization of all elements of a report directly in the Report designer. This CSS-like mechanism offers full control over such things as the background, colors, borders, and images for every item on your report.

> All Style properties of a report item that have **not** been specifically set for that report item will inherit the corresponding value from the report item's parent.

Below is a list of the available styling options alongside short summaries of what they represent:

<body>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Property</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>BackgroundColor</td>
			<td>A Color that represents the background color of the report item.
				Can be selected from the widget or written by hand as RGB, RGBA, or Hex color.
				<i>
				The default value is Empty, which indicates
				that this property is not set.
				</i>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>BackgroundImage</td>
			<td>Represents the image to display in the background of the report item. 
				Supports BMP, GIF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, ICO, EMF, and WMF image files.
				<ul>
					<li>ImageData - An Image containing the image data of this BackgroundImage. Use this property if you
						want to bind the BackgroundImage to an image that is not in the data source.</li>
					<li>MimeType - The MIME type of the current BackgroundImage object.</li>
					<li>Repeat - Indicates how a background image will be repeated.
						The available values are:
						<ul>
							<li>NoRepeat - The background image will be displayed only once.</li>
							<li>Repeat - The background image will be repeated vertically and horizontally.</li>
							<li>RepeatX - The background image will be repeated horizontally.</li>
							<li>RepeatY - The background image will be repeated vertically.
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<i>
				Report items have no background
				image by default.
				</i>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>BorderColor</td>
			<td>The border color of the item can be set by using the properties Default, Left, Right, Top, and Bottom.
				The Default property is used to set all border colors at once.
				<i>All borders are Black by default.</i>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>BorderStyle</td>
			<td>The border style of the item can be set by using the properties Default, Left, Right, Top, and Bottom.
				The Default property is used to set all border styles at once.
				The available border styles are:
				<ul>
					<li>None - No line.</li>
					<li>Solid - Solid line.</li>
					<li>Dotted - Dotted line.</li>

			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>BorderWidth</td>
			<td>The border width of the item can be set by using the properties Default, Left, Right, Top, and Bottom.
				The Default property is used to set all border widths at once, however, the more specific rules will override the Default setting.
				For example, if you set the Default and then you set only the Top, then the Default will be applied to Bottom, Left, and Right only.
				<i>All borders are 1pt wide by default.</i>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Color</td>
			<td>The foreground Color of the report item.
				Can be selected from the widget or written by hand as RGB, RGBA, or Hex color.

</body>

## Notes

* Some of the style properties behave differently in specific scenarios.

	For example, in the graph series' [DataPointStyle](/api/telerik.reporting.graphseriesbase), instead of using the BorderColor/BorderStyle/BorderWidth properties to style the graph's data points, you should use the LineColor/LineWidth/LineStyle properties.

* Consider using numerical codes as (A)RGB or HEX when setting style colors. Using color names is not guaranteed to work in all scenarios.

	For example, the color name '_ControlDarkDark_' corresponds to [SystemColors.ControlDarkDark](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.systemcolors.controldarkdark) is translated to [ThreeDDarkShadow](https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords) color, which is an obsolete CSS2 color and is rendered as RGB (0,0,0) by modern browsers.

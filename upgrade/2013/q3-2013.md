# Changes in the Q3 2013 Release

This article explains the manual changes required when upgrading to Telerik Reporting Q3 2013 (7.2.13.1016).

## WPF Report Viewer Dependencies

The viewer is build with Telerik UI Controls for WPF 2013.3.1016.40. If you are using a newer version consider adding binding redirects. For more information see: [How to Add report viewer to a WPF .NET Framework project]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/wpf-application/how-to-add-report-viewer-to-a-wpf-.net-framework-project%}).

## Silverlight Report Viewer Dependencies

The viewer is build with Telerik UI Controls for Silverlight 2013.3.1016.1050. 

## Database Cache Provider

If you are using our [Database Cache Provider]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/export-and-configure/cache-management/other-reportviewer-controls/configuring-the-database-cache-provider%}) you will have to upgrade Telerik Data Access assemblies to Q2 2013 SP1 or newer. 

## Graph

__Telerik.Reporting.GraphSeries.Legend__ property is now obsolete. If you have use it in your code you have to change it to __Telerik.Reporting.GraphSeries.LegendItem.Value__ property instead. Otherwise opening the report in the designer and making any change will re-serialize the report definition with the new property. 

## CSV rendering

Byte order mark(BOM) is no longer written by default in CSV documents. This behavior can now be switched using the "WriteBOM" device info parameter. 

## Standalone Report Designer

TRDX files created by the Standalone Report Designer contain XML version __http://schemas.telerik.com/reporting/2012/3.4__.

# R2 2016



This article explains the manual changes required when upgrading to Telerik Reporting R2 2016 (10.1.16.504).

## Known Issues

* Report viewers Visual Studio item templates: Fail when trdp report definition is used for existing report and with sample report option.             

* Standalone Report Designer: The Data Source design time parameter values are lost on saving the report in different report format               (from .trdp to trdx and from trdx to trdp)             

* Printing reports: Paper size is not respected when using __Custom__  paper kind.             

## Changes

### Standalone Report Designer

New default report document format is used by the [Overview]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/overview%}) - Telerik Report Definition Package (.trdp).               The new format holds the serialized XML report definition and its resources in archived package.               This way the document format is faster to handle and more compact.               The format is fully supported by all report viewers and Report Server.               We continue to fully support the legacy .trdx report format. Thus no change is required on your side.             

TRDX files created by the Standalone Report Designer contain XML version __http://schemas.telerik.com/reporting/2012/4.0__ 

### Reporting API Breaking Change

The interface  [IToggleVisibilityTarget](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.IToggleVisibilityTarget)  is now __obsolete__ .               Please use the  [IActionTarget](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.IActionTarget) interface instead.             

The class Telerik.Reporting.ToggleVisibilityTargetCollection is now __deprecated__ .               Please use the  [ActionTargetCollection](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.ActionTargetCollection) class instead.

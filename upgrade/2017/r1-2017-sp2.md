# R1 2017 SP2



This article explains the manual changes required when upgrading to Telerik Reporting R1 2017 SP2 (11.0.17.406).

## Changes

### Built-in functions

[Format(format, value) text function]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/expressions-reference/functions/text-functions%}) is evaluated using the current item's culture                instead of using the culture of the current thread.             

### HTML5 Report Viewer

The report viewer's default template file *telerikReportViewerTemplate.html*  has been modified:         

* A "*trv-report-pager* " class has been added to the toolbar page number input list item,                so it can be easily accessible and customizable via CSS rules.             

* A non-breaking space has been added between the Export button icons for readability.             

It is recommended to update the template manually with the above changes when using a custom template file.

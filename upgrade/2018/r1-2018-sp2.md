The Shape outlines are drawn with [Pen](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.pen?view=dotnet-plat-ext-7.0) that has [Alignment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.pen.alignment?view=dotnet-plat-ext-7.0) set to [Inset](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.drawing2d.penalignment?view=dotnet-plat-ext-7.0) in order to draw correctly closed figures.

### WPF Report Viewer

The viewer is build with Telerik UI Controls for WPF `2018.1.220.40`. If you are using a newer version consider adding binding redirects.

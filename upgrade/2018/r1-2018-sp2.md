# R1 2018 SP2



This article explains the manual changes required when upgrading to Telerik Reporting R1 2018 SP2 (12.0.18.227).

## Changes

### Report Processing

DateTime scale shows axis label correctly when only one data point is displayed, instead of displaying January 1st of the current year.

The Shape item rendering has changed. The Shape outlines are drawn with                [Pen](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.pen(v=vs.110).aspx)                that has                [Alignment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.pen.alignment(v=vs.110).aspx)                set to                [Inset](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z62ath7a(v=vs.110).aspx)  in order to draw correctly closed figures.

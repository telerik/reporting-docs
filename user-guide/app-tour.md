# App Tour of the Web Report Designer

The fastest way to explore the Web Report Designer and to learn its basics is to start the built-in onboarding tour, which walks you through the Report Designer's main tools.

The app tour starts automatically the first time you open an application with an embedded Telerik Web Report Designer.

As illustrated by the video above, the main elements of the Web Report Designer's user interface are:

* An interactive **Design surface** where you  create and style your report.
* A **Components tray** which contains all of the items that you can add to the report.
* An **Explorer** providing a tree-based structure of everything that is already in the report, including the data structure.
* A **Properties area** which shows the properties and values for the currently selected component.
* A **Main menu** which lets you open, save, and interact with reports on a global level along with the **Asset Manager** which is where you store all of your assets.
* A **Preview** button which shows an exact representation of the designed report.
* A **Search box** which allows you to search the report instance for any properties (i.e., their names), component data source, and so on. The Search box also allows locating tools, like the components that can be added on top of searching in the report instance.

To view the app tour again, type `Start onboarding` in the search box.

# Web Report Designer User Guide: An Overview

The Web Report Designer User Guide is intended to assist the users of business applications with integrated Telerik Reporting. This guide aims to provide the knowledge required for the successful crafting and maintenance of reports. The primary audience for this user guide are business application users.

> If you are a developer who integrates Telerik Reporting into web applications, see the [developer-oriented technical section]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/web-report-designer/overview%}) of the Web Report Designer documentation or the [Getting Started tutorial]({%slug telerikreporting/getting-started/web-designer/set-up-and-create-basic-report%}). 

## What is the Web Report Designer?

The Web Report Designer is a tool developed to let business application users design, create, and export reports directly in their web browser without needing any additional software. The reports can source their data from various databases, for example, relational, multi-dimensional, ORM, or custom data-layer-based data sources.

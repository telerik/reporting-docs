## What is the Web Report Designer?

The Web Report Designer is a tool developed to let business application users design, create, and export reports directly in their web browser without needing any additional software. The reports can source their data from various databases, for example, relational, multi-dimensional, ORM, or custom data-layer-based data sources.

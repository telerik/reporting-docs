# Configuring the User Preferences in Web Report Designer

The **Workspace Preferences** provide options for personalizing the Web Report Designer interface without affecting the actual report content. These settings are user-specific and typically stored in the browser.

The Workspace Preferences are split into two categories:
* [Snapping](#snapping)&mdash;this category lists the options related to the automatic alignment of objects on the design surface of the Web Report Designer.
* [General](#general)&mdash;this category list options related to the behavior of the Web Report Designer.

## Snapping

Snapping is a feature that detects alignment opportunities while designing the report. You can enable or disable the following snapping option:

* **Snap to snap lines**—Helps you position elements relative to each other (for example, aligning TextBoxes, Charts, or Tables). Snap lines appear temporarily as you drag items and they are based on the edges or centers of nearby items.

## General

The `GENERAL` settings section provides options that control how the application behaves on startup and how it collects usage data to enhance functionality. You can configure the following options:

* **Preserve open reports on exit**—Controls whether the designer remembers which reports were open when you closed the application and automatically restores them at the next launch.

* **Collect non-personal usage data**—Controls whether to collect non-personal usage data. The data contains usage information about the software's screens and tools and is being used to improve its functionality.

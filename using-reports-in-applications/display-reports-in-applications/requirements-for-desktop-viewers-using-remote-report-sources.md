# Requirements For Desktop Viewers Using Remote Report Sources



When using WinForms and WPF report viewers to show reports that are hosted in a Telerik Report Server instance or resolved using a REST service, a few additional libraries need to be referenced.         Below is the list of these libraries along with a brief explanation of how to install and reference them.       


* __Telerik.Reporting.Services.HttpClient.dll__ - this assembly contains the client used to make requests               and process response from the REST service Web API. The assembly can be found in the __\bin__ subfolder of the Telerik Reporting installation folder.               Make sure the *CopyLocal* property is set to __true__.             

* [                System.Net.Http.Formatting.dll              ](                https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.http.formatting(v=vs.118).aspx              )                - contains classes for serializing and deserializing HTTP message body in a format based on the requested media type.             

* [                System.Net.Http.dll              ](                https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.http(v=vs.118).aspx              )                - contains classes of HTTP attributes.             

* [                Newtonsoft.Json.dll              ](                https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.http(v=vs.118).aspx              )                - a popular high-performance JSON framework for.NET             

The recommended way of obtaining the three third-party assemblies is via NuGet package. The package that contains all three of them is            [            Microsoft ASP.NET Web API Client v.4.0.30506 NuGet package.          ](            https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client/4.0.30506          )            Note that the higher versions of this package require updating the project's target framework to.NET 4.5 or later.

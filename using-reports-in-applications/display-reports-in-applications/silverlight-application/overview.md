# Silverlight Application Overview



The Silverlight Report Viewer allows developers to deliver reports produced by Telerik Reporting to any rich application         developed with Silverlight. The Silverlight viewer lives entirely on the client side, while the reports and the rendering engine are on the server         side (accessible through the [Telerik Reporting WCF Service]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-wcf-service/overview%})).

The toolbar on the Silverlight Report Viewer provides basic functionality for interacting with the currently-loaded report:

* Navigate forward in history

* Refresh

* Go to first page

* Go to previous page

* Go to a specific page

* Total number of pages

* Go to next page

* Go to last page

* Print Preview: switches between __Logical__ and __Physical__ page renderer. See [Rendering and Paging]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/rendering-and-paging/overview%}) for more info.             

* Print: use  [Telerik.ReportViewer.Silverlight.ReportViewer.UseNativePrinting](/reporting/api/Telerik.ReportViewer.Silverlight.ReportViewer#Telerik_ReportViewer_Silverlight_ReportViewer_UseNativePrinting)                to switch between Silverlight native print and [True Print]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/asp.net-web-forms-report-viewer/true-print%}).             

* Export: see [Export Formats]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/export-and-configure/export-formats%}) for available export formats.

## Silverlight report viewer specific properties

* [Telerik.ReportViewer.Silverlight.ReportViewer.ReportServiceUri](/reporting/api/Telerik.ReportViewer.Silverlight.ReportViewer#Telerik_ReportViewer_Silverlight_ReportViewer_ReportServiceUri)                - the location of the report service - absolute or relative  [Uri](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.uri%28VS.95%29.aspx).               If the uri is absolute, the same instance is returned. If the uri is relative,               a new absolute Uri based on the combination of Source of the current application and the given relative uri is created. The Source usually points to the application package (XAP).             

* [Telerik.ReportViewer.Silverlight.ReportViewer.Report](/reporting/api/Telerik.ReportViewer.Silverlight.ReportViewer#Telerik_ReportViewer_Silverlight_ReportViewer_Report)                - the  [assembly qualified name](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.type.assemblyqualifiedname.aspx)  of the Report type for the viewer to display;             

* [Telerik.ReportViewer.Silverlight.ReportViewer.UseNativePrinting](/reporting/api/Telerik.ReportViewer.Silverlight.ReportViewer#Telerik_ReportViewer_Silverlight_ReportViewer_UseNativePrinting)                - Specifies whether to use native Silverlight printing or [True Print]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/asp.net-web-forms-report-viewer/true-print%}). Default value is true.             


In order to use our Silverlight Report Viewer, you need a Silverlight application. In order to create such, you need the following tools installed:

## System Requirements

* Visual Studio 2010 or later.

* Silverlight 5

* The latest version of  [Silverlight Tools/SDK](http://silverlight.net/getstarted)  for Visual Studio 2010+ is needed for development             

* (optional) Expression Blend

> The Silverlight ReportViewer requires the Telerik Reporting WCF Service. For more information: [Telerik Reporting WCF Service]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-wcf-service/overview%}).           


## How it works

The Silverlight ReportViewer control is a composite of Telerik UI for Silverlight controls.           The viewer's functionality resides in Telerik.ReportViewer.Silverlight.dll and the viewer's UI in Telerik.ReportViewer.Silverlight.xaml.         

> The Silverlight ReportViewer control's template can be modified trough the corresponding theme's [Telerik.ReportViewer.Silverlight.xaml]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/silverlight-application/setting-a-theme-(using-implicit-styles)%}) file             and the Silverlight  [ReportViewer](/reporting/api/Telerik.ReportViewer.Silverlight.ReportViewer).           


The purpose of the Silverlight ReportViewer control is to display Telerik Reports and allow the user to interact with them.            Reports are processed and rendered on the server where __Telerik Reporting engine__ and            __Telerik WCF service__ run. The __Telerik Reporting WCF Service__ serves reports           to the Silverlight ReportViewer, and is responsible for managing the reports state and their resources as images.           The report in the viewer is rendered as standard XAML elements, as Canvas and TextBlock,           through Telerik Reporting XAML for Silverlight rendering mechanism.

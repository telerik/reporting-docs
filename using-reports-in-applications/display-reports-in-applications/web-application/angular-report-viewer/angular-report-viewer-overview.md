# Angular Report Viewer Overview

Integrate the Angular Report Viewer component in your Angular applications regardless of the module loader that you use (__WebPack__ or __SystemJS__). 

The Angular component is built on top of the [HTML5 Report Viewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/overview%}), which is the base for all Web-technologies report viewers as well. 

## Requirements

To successfully integrate the Angular Report Viewer component, ensure the following: 

1. Required Application Version: 

   + Angular 4+ application 

1. Required Service: 

   + The viewer requires a running instance of [Telerik Reporting REST Services]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/overview%}) in order to display reports. Make sure to [enable Cross-Origin Requests (CORS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/security/enabling-cross-origin-requests-in-web-api)  in the REST Service project. 

1. Required JavaScript libraries:

   +  [jQuery 3.2.1+](https://jquery.com/download/) 

1. The [Angular Report Viewer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@progress/telerik-angular-report-viewer) requires the following peer dependencies: 

   + @angular/common 

   + @angular/core 

   + rxjs 

   + jquery 

1. Required references to Telerik Kendo UI styles:

   +  [Less-Based Themes](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/styles-and-layout/appearance-styling); or 

   +  [Sass-Based Themes](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/styles-and-layout/sass-themes) 

## Browser Support

The Angular viewer is based on the [HTML5 Report Viewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/overview%}), thus the client browser should conform to the HTML5 Report Viewer [Browser Support]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/requirements-and-browser-support%}#browser-support).

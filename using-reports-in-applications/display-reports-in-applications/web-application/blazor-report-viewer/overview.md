# Blazor Report Viewer Overview



The Blazor Viewer is a component which can be used in Blazor applications. It is built on top of the         [HTML5 Report Viewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/overview%}) which is the base for the rest         of the Web-technologies report viewers as well.       

## Requirements

1. Required Application Version:             

   + Blazor 3.1+ application                 

1. Required Service:             

   + The viewer requires a running instance of [Telerik Reporting REST Services]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/overview%})                   in order to display reports. It can be hosted either in the same Blazor application or the viewer can reference a service hosted in                   another origin. In the later case make sure to                    [enable Cross-Origin Requests (CORS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cors?view=aspnetcore-3.1)  in the REST Service project.                 

1. Required JavaScript libraries:

   +  [jQuery 3.2.1+](https://jquery.com/download/) 

1. References to                 [Telerik Kendo UI Sass-Based Themes](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/styles-and-layout/sass-themes).             (Alternatively, the                [Less-Based Themes](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/styles-and-layout/appearance-styling)                can be used instead, but they are not compatible with Telerik UI for Blazor.)             

## Browser Support

The Blazor viewer is based on the [HTML5 Report Viewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/overview%}),           thus the client browser should conform to the HTML5 Report Viewer [Browser Support](143e5c03-e69d-416f-9ac0-85c397b22b8e#browser-support).         

## Demo

1. The complete example can be found in the installation folder of Telerik Reporting: C:\Program Files (x86)\Progress\Telerik Reporting __Version__ \Examples\CSharp\.

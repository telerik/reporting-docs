# Customizing Overview



The HTML5 MVC Report Viewer is built with customization in mind.        This means that JavaScript client library provides the default viewer behavior and operations while the entire layout/markup is provided through HTML5 templates.        The styling is based on CSS3 styles including the Kendo UI themes (again css styles).

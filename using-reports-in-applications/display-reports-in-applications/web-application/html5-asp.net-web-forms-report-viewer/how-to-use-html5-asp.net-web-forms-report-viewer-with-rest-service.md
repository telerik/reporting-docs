## Telerik Web Forms Report Viewer Form Item Template

The item template will adds.aspx page with HTML5 WebForms Report Viewer           and will enable the [Telerik Reporting REST WebAPI Service]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/overview%}).           The following describes the item template wizard steps:         

* To start the item template wizard, in __Solution Explorer__, select the target project. On the               __Project menu__, click __Add -> New Item__. In the                [Add New Item](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w0572c5b%28v=vs.100%29.aspx)                dialog box, navigate to the __Web__ category and select the __Telerik Web Forms Report Viewer Form__ item.             

* Accept the project build prompt. Click 'OK'.             

* The item template will open the __'Add new Report Viewer'__ dialog with the following steps:             

   1. __'Configure reporting engine'__ will configure the type of reporting engine that will process and render the reports.                   You have two options - REST service or Report server. Choose __Rest service__ option. This way, the reports will be processed                    and rendered by the REST service on the specified URL. On the right side of the dialog there are two options:                 

   + __Create new REST service__ - in case there is no REST service project setup in the solution.                       Choosing this option, the REST Service will be configured within the project.                     

   + __Use existing REST service__ - in case there is a REST service already configured.                       Choosing this option, you will have to enter a valid REST service URI.                       

  ![item-template-reporting-engine-rest](images/item-template-reporting-engine-rest.png)

   1. __'Configure report source'__ will choose a report definition for the report viewer. If                    __Create new REST service__ option was previously selected, you will have to choose one of the following three options.                   If, however, __Use existing REST service__ option was previously selected, you will only have the option to choose                    an existing report definition.                 

   + __Sample report definition__ - this option will create a sample report definition which will be shown in the new                        report viewer. It will be placed in a newly created folder called Reports at the root of the application. It can be either modified                        or changed with another.                     

   + __New report definition__ - this option will create a new report definition that will be opened for editing in                        the respective report designer. On the right side of the dialog, there are two possible options:                     

   + __TRDP report definition__ - will create a TRDP file with the entered __Report name__.                         

   + __Type report definition__ - will create a CS|VB file with the entered __Report name__                          either in an existing report library project or in a newly created one.                         

   + __Existing report definition__ - this option will prompt you to choose an existing report definition that will                        be shown in the report viewer. On the right side of the dialog there are three possible options:                     

   + __TRDP, TRBP or TRDX report definition__ - enter the path or browse to the report definition. Also, there is                           an option to enable adding the report definition to the project. In this case the report viewer will use a UriReportSource with                            the provided path to the file.                         

   + __Enter type report definition created in Visual Studio__ - enter the Assembly qualified name of the type                            report definition. In this case the report viewer will use a TypeReportSource with the provided Assembly qualified name.                         

   + __Select type report definition created in Visual Studio__ - select the type report definition from the resolved                            types in the solution. The engine will search for report types in all projects in the solution that have Telerik Reporting reference                            included. The VS item template will add the required __connection string__ from the reports project configuration                            file (if exists).                           

  ![item-template-report-source-rest](images/item-template-report-source-rest.png)

   1. __'Configure Report Viewer'__ exposes the option to enable                   [accessibility]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/accessibility%}) for the report viewer.                   

  ![Item Template Accessibility](images/item-template-accessibility.png)

After finishing, the item template automatically does the following:         

* Configures the NuGet packages, if necessary.             

* Adds __Global.asax__ if missing, and registers the service routes in the Global.asax.             

* Adds an __ASPX page with the configured HTML5 WebForms Report Viewer__.             

* Displays a __summary log__ that lists all of the made changes.             

## Examples

You can find the complete example setup in Telerik Reporting installation path. For example,            __C:\Program Files (x86)\Progress\Telerik Reporting {VERSION}\Examples\CSharp\WebFormsDemo__.

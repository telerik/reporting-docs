# HTML5 Report Viewer Overview

The HTML5 Report Viewer is a pure HTML5/JavaScript/CSS3 jQuery-based widget that enables the display of Telerik reports in an HTML page.

The HTML5 Report Viewer renders its content through the [Reporting HTML Rendering mechanism]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/rendering-and-paging/design-considerations-for-report-rendering/html-rendering-design-considerations%}).

The layout and styling are based on pure HTML5 templates and CSS3 styles and is fully customizable. The default implementation supports mobile as well as desktop browsers. The responsive layout adapts itself to the device display for best viewing experience. You can customize its visual appearance by using the Kendo UI themes.

If you encounter any issues when working with the HTML5 Report Viewer, note that the following:

* The recommended troubleshooting approach is to use the [Telerik Fiddler Everywhere](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) or other debugging proxy tool. Fiddler enables you to check the requests, their responses and statuses by navigating to **Inspectors** > **Request/Response** > **Raw**. In this way, you can check requests made to the Reporting REST service and determine if its URLs are correct and if the relative paths are correctly resolved. Depending on the way the application is hosted, you may need to [adjust relative paths](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178116.aspx).

* Alternatively, you can use the [Telerik Fiddler Jam](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) troubleshooting solution. Fiddler Jam installs as a browser extension and collects logs for requests and responses performed in the browser. The logs are securely stored and later you can share them with a third party for examination through a URL. Fiddler Jam is being actively developed and, in terms of deployment and integration, might be a better choice than Fiddler Everywhere.

## Report Preview Area

The Report Preview area provides the placeholder for the rendered report. All commands provided by the toolbar operate on the report currently shown in this area.

It has built-in support for end-user interactions such as drill-down and drill-through, navigation to bookmarks in the report and external URLs.

## Toolbar

The toolbar of the HTML5 report viewer provides basic functionality for interacting with the currently-loaded report:

## Report Parameters

The parameters pane provides intuitive UI for user input. The HTML5-based Report Viewers use [Kendo UI widgets](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui) for parameter editors out-of-the-box. Based on the type of the parameters, a suitable editor UI is created.

List of the default widgets for different report parameters' types:

* DateTime: [Kendo UI DatePicker widget](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/controls/editors/datepicker/overview). Even though the time part cannot be selected via the Kendo UI DatePicker widget UI it is still passed to the report engine as a default time part (12:00:00 AM) with the DateTime value. If needed, the viewer can be [customized]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/customizing/overview%}) to use a Kendo UI DateTimePicker or another widget which allows selecting the time part explicitly. When a DateTime value is selected in the parameters area of the HTML5 Report Viewer it is interpreted as UTC DateTime on the server where the report is processed and rendered. For example, entering 1/1/2000 12:00:00 AM in a DateTimePicker report parameter widget and rendering the report will result in the following DateTime value on the server and in the rendered report - 1/1/2000 12:00:00 AM considered as a UTC time.

* Integer | Float | String: [Kendo UI ListView widget](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/controls/data-management/listview/overview). The default editor could be easily changed to [Kendo UI ComboBox](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/combobox)  (for single select parameters) and [Kendo UI MultiSelect](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/multiselect) (for multi select parameters) editors. For more information, check __parameters__ option in [Report Viewer Initialization]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/api-reference/report-viewer-initialization%}) article.

When at least one [report parameter]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/report-parameters/overview%}) has its Visible property turned on a parameter area is shown as part of the report viewer. This helps the report developer to easily provide input method for the end users. Based on the type of the parameters, a suitable editor UI is created. Parameter layout on the parameter area is formatted automatically. The order is determined by the order in which parameters appear in the [ReportParameters collection editor]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/tools/reportparameter-collection-editor%}). The end user can enter or select values in the editors.

When at least one visible report parameter has AutoRefresh property turned off a __Preview__ button appears. In this case to preview the report, the end user should click the Preview button. If all parameters have default values, the report runs automatically on first view. You can show or hide the parameters area from the __Parameters__ button in the report viewerâ€™s toolbar.

## Document Map

The document map pane provides a set of navigational links to report items in a rendered report. When you view a report that has a document map, a separate side pane appears next to the report preview area. A user can click a link in the document map to jump to the report page that displays the corresponding item. Report sections and groups are arranged in the hierarchy of links. Clicking items in the document map refreshes the report preview and displays the area of the report that corresponds to the item in the document map.

To add links to the document map, you set the __DocumentMapText__ property of the report item to text that you create or to an expression that evaluates to the text that you want display in the document map.

## Page Modes

The [page modes]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/api-reference/report-viewer-initialization%}) are two. __Continuous scrolling__ and __Single page__. The Single page mode renders only one page in the view port. This mode does not hinder the browser with a lot of DOM objects, actions or event listeners, but limits the report data that user could read.

The Continuous scroll mode gives the user the ability to read all report pages at once. When the report is ready, in the viewport are rendered N number of pages to fill in the visible part of your report viewer. Each next or previous page will be loaded on demand if the user scrolls up or down. If the user navigates to 5th page for example, in the DOM tree will be rendered all pages that are visible in the viewport, before and after the wanted page, plus all their actions and event listeners. All other pages, that are out of the visible part, will not be loaded. On their place will be added skeleton pages, that will be replaced with the actual page, only if the user scrolls to them.

Continuous scroll mode is the default page mode. To change the page mode, check __pageMode__ option in [Report Viewer Initialization]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/api-reference/report-viewer-initialization%}) article.

## How it works

The HTML5 Report Viewer is a composite of Telerik Kendo Ui widgets, which template consists of three files: HTML (UI), CSS (styles), JS (functionality). The viewer can be styled and customized with standard JavaScript, CSS and custom HTML. For more details refer to [HTML5  Report Viewer Customizing]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/customizing/overview%}) articles.

The purpose of the HTML5 Report Viewer is to display Telerik Reports and allow the user to interact with them. Reports are processed and rendered on the server where __Telerik Reporting engine__ and __Reporting REST service__ run. Reports and their resources are handled and delivered to the viewer through the [Reporting REST service]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/overview%}).

The HTML5 Report Viewer's content is rendered in __DIV__ elements. The report in the viewer is rendered through the HTML rendering mechanism based on the [Design Considerations for HTML Rendering]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/rendering-and-paging/design-considerations-for-report-rendering/html-rendering-design-considerations%}).

# How to Use Windows Forms Report Viewer With Report Server



This topic explains how to setup the Windows Forms Report Viewer to work with Telerik Report Server

## Prerequisites

* Installed and running                [Telerik Report Server](http://docs.telerik.com/report-server/introduction)  R2 2016 (2.1.16.x) or higher version.             

* A valid (enabled) user account - the built-in __Guest__  user account can be used as well.             

* In case you are not using [Item Templates ]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/windows-forms-application/how-to-add-report-viewer-to-a-windows-forms'-.net-framework-project%}),               add references to all the assemblies listed               [here]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/requirements-for-desktop-viewers-using-remote-report-sources%}).             

## Configuring the Windows Forms Report Viewer to work with Report Server

###

1. To create a form and host the report viewer in it, you can either use the item template, as explained                   [here]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/windows-forms-application/how-to-add-report-viewer-to-a-windows-forms'-.net-framework-project%}), or place it yourself through drag-and-drop from the toolbox.                 

1. As soon as the report viewer is on your form, select it and locate the __ReportEngineConnection__  property.                   invoke the UI editor by pressing the ellipsis button. The Report Engine Connection Editor dialog should appear:

1. The __Reporting engine__  combobox provides the following options:                 
   + *Embedded*  - the reports will be processed and rendered at the local machine that hosts the viewer. This is the default mode in order to preserve backwards compatibility.                     

   + *REST Service*  - the reports will be processed at the machine that hosts configured and running REST Service instance.                     

   + *Report Server*  - the reports will be processed and rendered at the machine that hosts configured and running                        [Telerik Report Server ](http://docs.telerik.com/report-server/introduction)  instance.                     
    Select *Report Server* .                 

1. In __Report Server URL__  textbox enter the address and port (if needed) of the machine that hosts the Report Server instance.                 

1. In __Username__  textbox enter the user account that will be used to access the report or leave it empty if you want to use the built-in __Guest__  account.                 

1. In __Password__  textbox enter the password associated with the account or leave it empty if you want to use the built-in __Guest__  account.                 

1. In the __Document timeout__  textbox you can change the timeout for rendering a document, the default is 100 seconds.                 

1. Uncheck the __Keep client alive__  checkbox if you want the client session to expire.                 

1. Click __OK__  when ready. The dialog will close and the resulting connection string will be populated as a value of the __ReportEngineConnection__  property.                 

1. Locate the __ReportSource__  property. Invoke the UI editor by pressing the ellipsis button. The Report Source Editor dialog should appear:                   

  ![Winforms Report Source Editor](images/WinformsReportSourceEditor.png)

1. Select the __Report server__  option. The dialog will try to connect to a report server instance, using the credentials you provided earlier. In case it succeeds, the dialog                   will populate its *Category*  and *Report Name*  comboboxes, allowing you to select the desired report.                   If the report server is not available at the moment, you can still write down the category and report name in the comboboxes and their values will be used to create the report source for the viewer.                     If needed, you can setup the report source parameters using the dialog, invoked by pressing the __Edit Parameters__  button.                 

1. Click __OK__  when ready. The dialog will close and the resulting report source will be populated as a value of the __ReportSource__  property.                 

1. Build and run your application. If your settings are configured correctly, you should see the report, hosted on your Report Server instance, displayed in the report viewer of your WinForms application.                   If not, check the                   [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) section below.                 

## Troubleshooting

The most common reasons for failure are related with the authentication against Report Server. It is strongly recommended to use a tool like           Fiddler or any other web debugger when investigating such a problem.         


| Problem | Cause |
| ------ | ------ |
|The viewer displays the message:`A problem occurred while registering client.`|Check if the supplied username and password are valid and the user's state is __Enabled__ in Report Server.|
|The viewer displays the message:`System.OperationCanceledException: *{ReportName}* report cannot be found`|Make sure the URL specified in the report source __report__ is valid and such a category and report exist in Report Server.|
|The viewer displays the message:`System.Net.WebException: The remote name could not be resolved: {server name}`|Make sure that the server specified in the connection string exists and has a valid and running Report Server instance|

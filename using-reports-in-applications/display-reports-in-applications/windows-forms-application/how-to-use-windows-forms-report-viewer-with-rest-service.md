# How to Use Windows Forms Report Viewer With REST Service



This topic explains how to setup the Windows Forms Report Viewer to work with Telerik Reporting REST Service

## Prerequisites

* Running               [Telerik Reporting REST Service]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/overview%}) instance.             

* In case you are not using [Item Templates]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/windows-forms-application/how-to-add-report-viewer-to-a-windows-forms'-.net-framework-project%}),               add references to all the assemblies listed                [here]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/requirements-for-desktop-viewers-using-remote-report-sources%}).             

## Configuring the Windows Forms Report Viewer to work with REST Service


1. To create a form and host the report viewer in it, you can either use the item template, as explained                   [here]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/windows-forms-application/how-to-add-report-viewer-to-a-windows-forms'-.net-framework-project%}), or place it yourself through drag-and-drop from the toolbox.                 

1. As soon as the report viewer is on your form, select it and locate the __ReportEngineConnection__ property.                   invoke the UI editor by pressing the ellipsis button. The Report Engine Connection Editor dialog should appear:

1. The __Reporting engine__ combobox provides the following options:                 
   + *Embedded* - the reports will be processed and rendered at the local machine that hosts the viewer. This is the default mode in order to preserve backwards compatibility.                     

   + *REST Service* - the reports will be processed at the machine that hosts configured and running REST Service instance.                     

   + *Report Server* - the reports will be processed and rendered at the machine that hosts configured and running                        [Telerik Report Server](http://docs.telerik.com/report-server/introduction)  instance.                     
    Select *REST Service*.                 

1. In __URL__ textbox enter the address and port (if needed) of the machine that hosts the REST Service instance.                   Note that the */api/reports* part is already added so you need to prefix it with the service address.                 

1. Check the __Use default credentials__ checkbox if you need the default credentials to be sent with the requests by the                    [HTTP client handler](https://msdn.microsoft.com/query/dev14.query?appId=Dev14IDEF1&l&EN-US&k=k(System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler.UseDefaultCredentials))                    that is used internally to communicate with the REST service.                 

1. In the __Document timeout__ textbox you can change the timeout for rendering a document, the default is 100 seconds.                 

1. Uncheck the __Keep client alive__ checkbox if you want the client session to expire.                 

1. Click __OK__ when ready. The dialog will close and the resulting connection string will be populated as a value of the __ReportEngineConnection__ property.                 

1. Locate the __ReportSource__ property. Invoke the UI editor by pressing the ellipsis button. The Report Source Editor dialog should appear:                   

  ![Winforms Report Source Editor URL](images/WinformsReportSourceEditor_URL.png)

    >When the                      [ReportEngineConnection](/reporting/api/Telerik.ReportViewer.WinForms.ReportViewerBase#Telerik_ReportViewer_WinForms_ReportViewerBase_ReportEngineConnection)                      property has  __Engine__ set to *RestService*,                     the viewer will serialize the report source identifier property                     (__URI__ for                      [UriReportSource](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.UriReportSource),                      __TypeName__ for                      [TypeReportSource](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.TypeReportSource),                      __ReportDocument__ for                      [InstanceReportSource](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.InstanceReportSource)  and                      __XML__ for                      [XmlReportSource](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.XmlReportSource)) and send it to the service resolver.                   The *REST service* will use the  __ReportResolver__ instances included in its                      [ReportServiceConfiguration](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.Service.ReportServiceConfiguration)  to resolve the report by the provided identifier.                     However, the *REST service* 's default implementation includes only                      [ReportFileResolver](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.Service.ReportFileResolver)  and                      [ReportTypeResolver](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.Service.ReportTypeResolver),                     so you need to provide a                     [Custom Report Source Resolver]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/rest-service-report-source-resolver/how-to-implement-a-custom-report-source-resolver%}) if you use another type of                      [ReportSource](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.ReportSource).                   

1. In this scenario we will use a  [UriReportSource](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.UriReportSource).                   Select the __URL or file__ radio button. Enter the path and the name of the report you want to display.                     If needed, you can setup the report source parameters using the dialog, invoked by pressing the __Edit Parameters__ button.                 

1. Click __OK__ when ready. The dialog will close and the resulting report source will be populated as a value of the __ReportSource__ property.                 

1. Build and run your application. If your settings are configured correctly, you should see the report displayed in the report viewer of your WinForms application.                   If not, check the                   [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) section below.                 

## Troubleshooting

The following table shows the most common reasons for failure when using the Telerik Reporting REST Service. It is strongly recommended to use a tool like           Fiddler or any other web debugger when investigating such a problem.         


| Problem | Cause |
| ------ | ------ |
|The viewer displays the message:`A problem occurred while registering client.`|Check if the REST service is active and running - the easiest way is to make a request for the available document formats, as explained [here]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/asp.net-web-api-implementation/how-to-add-telerik-reporting-rest-web-api-to-web-application%}).|
|The viewer displays the message:`System.OperationCanceledException: *{ReportName}* report cannot be resolved.`|Make sure the URL or type name specified in the __report source__ property is valid and can be resolved by the REST service.|
|The viewer displays the message:`System.Net.WebException: The remote name could not be resolved: {name}`|Make sure that the address specified in the connection string exists and represents a valid and running REST service instance.|

# Windows Forms Application Overview



The Windows Forms Report Viewer is designed to render Telerik __Reports__ within Windows Forms projects.

The toolbar on the Windows Forms Report Viewer provides basic functionality for interacting with the currently-loaded report:

* Navigate back in history

* Navigate forward in history

* Stop loading (useful when a large report is taking a long time to load)             

* Refresh

* Go to first page

* Go to previous page

* Go to a specific page

* Total number of pages

* Go to next page

* Go to last page

* Page Setup (set paper kind, orientation, margins)

* Print Preview: switches between __Logical__ and __Physical__ page renderer. See [Rendering and Paging]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/rendering-and-paging/overview%}) for more info.             

* Print

* Export: see [Export Formats]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/export-and-configure/export-formats%}) for available export formats.             

* Zoom level

* Show/Hide parameters area

* Show/Hide document map

>.NET Framework  __Client Profile__ is not supported.           


## How it works

The Windows Forms ReportViewer control is a composite of standard Windows Forms controls.         

> The Windows Forms ReportViewer control's toolbar is immutable. To build custom UI for the toolbar and work with the rendered report in the viewer,             you can use the Windows Forms  [ReportViewer](/reporting/api/Telerik.ReportViewer.WinForms.ReportViewer).           


The purpose of the Windows Forms ReportViewer control is to display Telerik Reports and allow the user to interact with them.           Reports are processed and rendered on the client machine. The report in the viewer is rendered through Telerik Reporting IMAGE rendering mechanism based on the           [Design Considerations for Image Rendering]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/rendering-and-paging/design-considerations-for-report-rendering/image-rendering-design-considerations%}).         

## Declaring the application as DPI-aware

When using Windows Forms ReportViewer on a machine with Windows Vista and later operating system and DPI scale factor higher than 96, the form content           (labels, buttons, rendered report image, etc.) might be rendered fuzzy, pixelated and with other visual artifacts.           This is because the application in which you are using the Windows Forms Report Viewer is not declared as DPI aware. The recommended approach for declaring an application           as DPI aware is adding a __dpiAware__ element to its application manifest, as shown below:         

    
````xml
<assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" manifestVersion="1.0" xmlns:asmv3="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3" >
  <asmv3:application>
    <asmv3:windowsSettings xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2005/WindowsSettings">
      <dpiAware>True</dpiAware>
    </asmv3:windowsSettings>
  </asmv3:application>
</assembly>
````

Since Windows 10 Anniversary Update, the Windows runtime has improved the UX for Windows Forms applications that are not declared as DPI-aware. Unfortunately in some cases this behavior leads to incorrect calculation of interactive item positions. We recommend always declaring the Windows Forms application as DPI-aware.         

You can read more about writing DPI-aware desktop applications            [            here.          ](            https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn469266(v=vs.85).aspx          ) 

## Keyboard shortcuts

The following table lists the keyboard and mouse commands used in Windows Forms Report Viewer. The commands use the CTRL key as modifier that changes the applied action.

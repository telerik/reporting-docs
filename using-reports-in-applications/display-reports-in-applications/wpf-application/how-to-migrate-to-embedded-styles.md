# How to Migrate to embedded styles



With Telerik Reporting R2 2018 SP1 we have introduces implicit XAML styles embedded in         the new Telerik.ReportViewer.Wpf.Themes assembly.         This will further simplify the update process and no manual XAML styles replacement is required.         Once the project is migrated to embedded XAML style, the Upgrade Wizard will         automatically update the Telerik.ReportViewer.Wpf.Themes assembly.       

Migration to embedded XAML styles is only possible for the default implicit XAML styles, that haven't been previously modified.

# How to Use WPF Report Viewer With Report Server



This topic explains how to setup the WPF Report Viewer to work with Telerik Report Server

## Prerequisites

* Installed and running                [Telerik Report Server](http://docs.telerik.com/report-server/introduction)  R2 2016 (2.1.16.x) or higher version.             

* A valid (enabled) user account - the built-in __Guest__ user account can be used as well.             

* In case you are not using [Item Templates]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/windows-forms-application/how-to-add-report-viewer-to-a-windows-forms'-.net-framework-project%}),               add references to all the assemblies listed               [here]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/requirements-for-desktop-viewers-using-remote-report-sources%}).             

## Configuring the WPF Report Viewer to work with Report Server


1. To create a window and host the report viewer in it, you can either use the item template, as explained                   [here]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/wpf-application/how-to-add-report-viewer-to-a-wpf-.net-framework-project%}), or place it yourself through drag-and-drop from the toolbox.                 

1. As soon as the report viewer is on your form, select it and locate the __ReportEngineConnection__ property.                   invoke the UI editor by pressing the ellipsis button. The Report Engine Connection dialog should appear:

1. The __Reporting engine__ combobox provides the following options:                 
   + *Embedded* - the reports will be processed and rendered at the local machine that hosts the viewer. This is the default mode in order to preserve backwards compatibility.                     

   + *REST Service* - the reports will be processed at the machine that hosts configured and running REST Service instance.                     

   + *Report Server* - the reports will be processed and rendered at the machine that hosts configured and running                        [Telerik Report Server](http://docs.telerik.com/report-server/introduction)  instance.                     
    Select *Report Server*.                 

1. In __Report Server URL__ textbox enter the address and port (if needed) of the machine that hosts the Report Server instance.                 

1. In __Username__ textbox enter the user account that will be used to access the report or leave it empty if you want to use the built-in __Guest__ account.                 

1. In __Password__ textbox enter the password associated with the account or leave it empty if you want to use the built-in __Guest__ account.                 

1. In the __Document timeout__ textbox you can change the timeout for rendering a document, the default is 100 seconds.                 

1. Uncheck the __Keep client alive__ checkbox if you want the client session to expire.                 

1. Click __OK__ when ready. The dialog will close and the resulting connection string will be populated as a value of the __ReportEngineConnection__ property.                 

1. Locate the __ReportSource__ property. Invoke the UI editor by pressing the __New__ button. The default property editor, provided by Visual Studio, should appear:

    >When the                      [ReportEngineConnection](/reporting/api/Telerik.ReportViewer.Wpf.ReportViewer#Telerik_ReportViewer_Wpf_ReportViewer_ReportEngineConnection)                      property has  __Engine__ set to *RestService* or *ReportServer*,                     the viewer will serialize the report source identifier property                     (__URI__ for                      [UriReportSource](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.UriReportSource),                      __TypeName__ for                      [TypeReportSource](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.TypeReportSource),                      __ReportDocument__ for                      [InstanceReportSource](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.InstanceReportSource)  and                      __XML__ for                      [XmlReportSource](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.XmlReportSource)) and send it to the service resolver.                   The *ReportServer* will try to decompose the identifier using the format `{Category}/{ReportName}` and then look for the corresponding category and report name.                   

1. In this scenario we will use a  [UriReportSource](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.UriReportSource).                   Select the __UriReportSource__ entry. Confirm by clicking __OK__.                 

1. Expand the __ReportSource__ node in Properties window. In the provided __Uri__ textbox enter the category and the name of the report you want to display using the following format: `{Category}/{ReportName}`, as shown below:

1. Build and run your application. If your settings are configured correctly, you should see the report, hosted on your Report Server instance, displayed in the report viewer of your WPF application.                   If not, check the                   [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) section below.                 

> When setting  [ReportEngineConnection](/reporting/api/Telerik.ReportViewer.Wpf.ReportViewer#Telerik_ReportViewer_Wpf_ReportViewer_ReportEngineConnection)  with code, make sure you call               the  [RefreshReport](/reporting/api/Telerik.ReportViewer.Wpf.ReportViewer#Telerik_ReportViewer_Wpf_ReportViewer_RefreshReport) () method                or set the  [ReportSource](/reporting/api/Telerik.ReportViewer.Wpf.ReportViewer#Telerik_ReportViewer_Wpf_ReportViewer_ReportSource)  property afterwards,                so the connection's new value will be respected.           


## Troubleshooting

The most common reasons for failure are related with the authentication against Report Server. It is strongly recommended to use a tool like           Fiddler or any other web debugger when investigating such a problem.         


| Problem | Cause |
| ------ | ------ |
|The viewer displays the message:`A problem occurred while registering client.`|Check if the supplied username and password are valid and the user's state is __Enabled__ in Report Server.|
|The viewer displays the message:`System.OperationCanceledException: *{ReportName}* report cannot be found`|Make sure the URL specified in the report source __report__ is valid and such a category and report exist in Report Server.|
|The viewer displays the message:`System.Net.WebException: The remote name could not be resolved: {server name}`|Make sure that the server specified in the connection string exists and has a valid and running Report Server instance.|

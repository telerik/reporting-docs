# Configuring the File Cache Provider



> The cache settings mentioned in this article are not obligatory, and they do not apply to the            __HTML5 Viewer__ or its Angular, WebForms and MVC wrappers. Details about the Cache Storage of the Reporting REST           Service that works with the HTML5 Viewer are available in           [Cache Management: HTML5 Report Viewer and Reporting REST services]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/export-and-configure/cache-management/html5-report-viewer-and-reporting-rest-services%})           and [REST Service Storage Settings]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/rest-service-storage/overview%}).         


The file cache provider is used to cache rendered pages and resources as temporary files on disk. This can help         reducing the memory footprint of the application without sacrificing the performance significantly. It is necessary to configure         the [Telerik Reporting Configuration Section]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/export-and-configure/configure-the-report-engine/overview%}) first and then use the following XML snippet that         configures the viewers in the application to use the file cache provider:       

    
````xml
<Telerik.Reporting>
  <Cache provider="File" />
</Telerik.Reporting>
````

By default, this provider stores the files in the temporary folder of the current user. However it can be configured to store         the files in another location by specifying the "BasePath" parameter, as illustrated below:       

    
````xml
<Telerik.Reporting>
  <Cache provider="File">
    <Providers>
      <Provider name="File">
        <Parameters>
          <Parameter name="BasePath" value="C:\MyDataCache" />
        </Parameters>
      </Provider>
    </Providers>
  </Cache>
</Telerik.Reporting>
````

The __BasePath__ can represent either an absolute path on disk or a relative path. In the latter case the path is mapped to the         applicationâ€™s working directory.       

> In web applications deployed on a web farm, the  __BasePath__ parameter should           specify a shared folder with the necessary permissions which should be accessible from all servers.

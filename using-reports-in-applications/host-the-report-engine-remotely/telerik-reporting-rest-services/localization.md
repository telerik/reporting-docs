# Localization



The service renders the report with the request thread culture.         By default the request thread respects the host's default locale.         In order the request thread to respect the clients/browsers preferred language settings you should add in the root web.config file         the following globalization element:       

    
````xml
<globalization culture="auto" uiCulture=”auto” />
````

Then the user agent (the browser) preferred language will be used as culture.

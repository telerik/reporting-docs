# ServiceStack Implementation Overview



The ServiceStack implementation of the Telerik Reporting REST Service is a __REST__ ful web service         built upon the  [ServiceStack](https://servicestack.net/)  framework.       


In order to utilize the service, you have to create a new class which inherits from the abstract            [ReportsHostBase](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.Services.ServiceStack.ReportsHostBase)            class. The *ReportsHostBase* class contains one important property needed by the reporting           engine:  [ReportServiceConfiguration](/reporting/api/Telerik.Reporting.Services.ServiceStack.ReportsHostBase#Telerik_Reporting_Services_ServiceStack_ReportsHostBase_ReportServiceConfiguration).         

The service can be hosted on [IIS]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/servicestack-implementation/how-to-add-telerik-reporting-rest-servicestack-to-web-application%}) or self-hosted.         

As Telerik Reporting ServiceStack REST service is a pure HTTP web service it can be accessed           with any HTTP-capable client. For example you can create one of the following clients in order           to utilize the service:         

* JavaScript client

* C# client

* Silverlight client

The service can be used from the [HTML5 Report Viewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/web-application/html5-report-viewer/overview%}),           [Windows Forms ReportViewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/windows-forms-application/how-to-use-windows-forms-report-viewer-with-report-server%})           and [WPF ReportViewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/wpf-application/how-to-use-wpf-report-viewer-with-report-server%}) as well.         

The current ServiceStack implementation is based on            [ServiceStack](https://servicestack.net/)            V3 __(3.9.70.0)__ 

> The  __Telerik Reporting ServiceStack REST Service__ should be the only ServiceStack based Web Service in a project, as all ServiceStack services have  [a single AppHost per AppDomain](              http://mono.servicestack.net/ServiceStack.Hello/#AppHost            ).

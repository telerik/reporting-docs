# How to Self Host the Service



The advantages of a Self-Hosted service:

* Easy to use: With only a few lines of code you have your service running.

* Easy to debug: Debugging WCF services that are hosted in a self-hosted 
			environment provides a familiar way of debugging, without having to attach to 
			separate applications that activate your service.

* Easy to deploy.

* Flexible: You can easily control the lifetime of your services.

* Supports all bindings and transport.

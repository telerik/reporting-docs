# Report Events Overview



Telerik Reports created in Visual Studio support events like ItemDataBinding, ItemDataBound,         NeedDataSource for [Data items]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/data-items/overview%}) and Error event for reports.         events are trigerred when data and the designed report start being processed by the Reporting Engine.       

## 

Events are a __legacy approach__  for modifying styles, providing data, and logging information about the processing report.         

Telerik Reporting provides different declarative means that replace the need for events           and provide the needed flexibility to handle most tasks:           [Using Expressions]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/overview%}),           [Conditional Formatting]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/styling-reports/conditional-formatting%}),           [Bindings]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/using-expressions/bindings%}) and           [User Functions]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/connecting-to-data/expressions/extending-expressions/user-functions%}).           These tools are typically the most productive way to build declarative reports and           should be favored over using events.Â Additionally events can't be used with           [Overview]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/overview%}) report documents,           because the custom code from events is not serialized in reports.         

>important Designed reports' structures should not be modified in events. Changes as of Telerik Reporting R3 2016,             in the internal processing of reports,             may affect reports using events upgraded to the latest version.

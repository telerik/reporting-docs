# Understanding Events



Report Events       

## 

Delivering a Telerik Report to the end user is a process involving several stages. Knowledge of the           [Report Life Cycle]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/understanding-the-report-lifecycle%}) is crucial to understanding how events work in           Telerik Reporting.         

## Report Definition

The Report Definition is created during the first stage of the life cycle. This is the actual .NET class           that represents the report. It is an instance of __Telerik.Reporting.Report__  or an instance of a subclass of the            __Telerik.Reporting.Report__  and contains information           about report items and their properties. Each item contained in the report gets added to a tree structure formed            from the Items property of the Report (the root) and the Items properties of its child items.            Additionally, if you are using the Visual Studio Report Designer,           for each added report item, by default the newly added item is also added as a private field of the report definition class,           in order to be easily accessible after the InitializeComponent method call.         

Let's illustrate this with an example. While in design-time, if you add a TextBox to the Detail Section of the report           that you are designing, a private field of type TextBox will be added to the code-behind file and some basic initialization code           will be generated within the InitalizeComponent method of the report class.         

>note The  __InitializeComponent__  method initializes (creates) a Report and its             child items. It is a special method recognized and parsed by the Report Designer in order to display the report in             design-time.           


This object will later serve as the definition for creating a concrete instance of the TextBox for each row from the           data source. These definition objects are of the types that reside in the Telerik.Reporting namespace, for example           Telerik.Reporting.TextBox.         

In order to programmatically change the report definition before rendering a report you need to place your code in the constructor of the report,            right after the InitializeComponent call (if present).         

## Report Processing

The second stage of the report life cycle involves combining the __report definition__            with the __data source__ . The processing engine performs all grouping, sorting and           filtering calculations and iterates over all records from the data source and creates the appropriate           __processing items__  based on the item definitions created earlier and the actual data.           Based on the original item definition (e.g. Telerik.Reporting.TextBox) and the actual data in the current           record a new item instance is created. This item is called a __processing item__             (e.g. Telerik.Reporting.Processing.TextBox)           and bears all characteristics of its definition item, but it is bound to the respective data field from the current           record. While the definition TextBox's Value property may contain something like "=Fields.FirstName", the processing           item's Value property will be equal to "John".         

The Processing Engine provides the developer a way to intervene in this process. Just before the           processing item is bound to data, the __ItemDataBinding__  event of its corresponding definition item           is raised. By subscribing a listener for this event, the developer can modify the newly created processing item before it gets data-bound           (i.e., definition expressions processed and result applied to the processing item).           The __processing item instance__  is exposed to the event handler methods as            the __sender__  parameter.         

In the __ItemDataBinding__  event handler you may change any property of the processing instance of the item           (e.g., positioning, stylization, item specific properties). Note that during the subsequent data binding the changed value            will get overridden if there is an expression defined to be applied on the property in question.         

After the processing item has been data bound the __ItemDataBound__  event           is raised. The purpose of this event is mainly to read the processing item instance property values,           which result from expressions evaluation. You might also change values of the processing item instance properties,           but for complex items this modification might not make effect as they are laid out and their inner content is already generated.         

>important Report Events are not intended to be used as a place/time to modify the report definition.             As of  __Q3 2016__  any changes on the report items' definitions             in processing stage events will not make effective change in the resulting report.             Report definition properties are read and cached when the report processing gets started.             In previous versions changes may take effect, resulting in changed output for all processing items              processed after the event handler execution.           


## Report Rendering

After processing is over, the processed report is ready for rendering in one of the available formats, see [Export Formats]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/export-and-configure/export-formats%}).           There are no events triggered during this stage of the report generation.
